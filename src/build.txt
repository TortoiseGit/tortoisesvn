- Install Python 2.2. You can get it from here:
  http://www.python.org/windows/
- Install Perl. Get it from http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/
- create a new folder on your harddisk, e.g. SVN.
  Now checkout the subversion source into this folder
  svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk Subversion
  Or if you're using TortoiseSVN to checkout the sources
  then right-click into the SVN folder and select "checkout".
  In the dialog enter the URL and add "\Subversion" to
  the checkout path.
- Download the newest source of the apache server
  for windows from http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
  Unzip the sources into SVN\Subversion
  Now open the Apache.dsw file and compile apache. After that
  copy (not move) the folders
  SVN\Subversion\httpd-2.0.46\srclib\apr to SVN\Subversion\apr
  SVN\Subversion\httpd-2.0.46\srclib\apr-iconv to SVN\Subversion\apr-iconv
  SVN\Subversion\httpd-2.0.46\srclib\apr-util to SVN\Subversion\apr-util
  Now open the Apache.dsw file and compile apache.
- Download the openssl source package from
  http://www.openssl.org/source/ and unzip it to SVN\common
  open a dos prompt and go to SVN\common\openssl
  run the file <installdir_of_vs.net>\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat
  > perl Configure VC-WIN32
  > ms\do_masm
  > nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
  don't close the dos-prompt, you'll need it later.
- Download the zlib source from 
  http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ and unzip it to SVN\common\zlib
  Copy the file zlib\msdos\Makefile.w32 to zlib\
  > nmake /f Makefile.w32
  > copy zlib.lib zlibstat.lib
- Download the newest neon source from 
  http://www.webdav.org/neon/ and unzip it into SVN\Subversion
  then rename the folder neon-0.23.9 to neon.
  edit the file SVN\Subversion\build\win32\build_neon.bat:
  @rem set OPENSSL_SRC=..\..\common\openssl
  @rem set ZLIB_SRC=..\..\common\zlib114-win32
  to
  set OPENSSL_SRC=..\..\common\openssl
  set ZLIB_SRC=..\..\common\zlib
  now in the dos-prompt go to the neon directory and type 
  > ..\build\win32\build_neon debug
  > ..\build\win32\build_neon release
- Download the compiled berkeley db library from
  the TortoiseSVN download area:
  http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=907
  and unzip it to SVN\Subversion\db4-win32
- in the dos-prompt cd to SVN\Subversion. Then type
  > python gen-make.py -t dsp
  this will create all the project files for visual studio.
  Double-click on the subversion_msvc.dsw file to open visual studio.
  Build the project called __ALL__. This will build all other projects
  in the workspace too. 
  Maybe the first time you'll get linker errors 'cause some files
  get generated but aren't added to the projects. Then you have
  to run
  > python gen-make.py -t dsp
  again and the next time you compile it'll be fine.
  Now you have successfully compiled Subversion!
  (Note: as of revision 5877 you'll get an error for
  the neon project. It won't compile with the subversion
  workspace, but since we already compiled it earlier
  subversion builds anyway)
- Checkout the TortoiseSVN sources from the Subversion repository.
  You need a subversion client to do this. Check it out to
  SVN\TortoiseSVN
  Open the solution file and compile.
