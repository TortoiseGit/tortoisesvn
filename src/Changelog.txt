       with items in it lead to a crash (Stefan)
- BUG: removed the unused "Help" button from the 
       settings page (Stefan)
- BUG: The coloring in the progress dialog was wrong 
       if the wc contained svn:externals (Stefan)
- BUG: TortoiseSVN wasn't working on Win98-based
       systems anymore 'cause we now use UNICODE.
       So changed the code to compile for either
       MBCS _or_ UNICODE. This means we have
       to provide two binary versions of TSVN 
       from now on (Stefan)
- CHG: The menu items now are properly aligned
       for both with and without icons (Stefan)
- CHG: merge/tag uses again an url->url copy
       command instead of a wc->url copy since
       this doesn't work for working copy root
       folders. (Stefan)

Version 0.9.1

       I went back to statically linked zlib (Stefan)

       file was in the folder (Stefan)
- ADD: in the commit dialog (logprompt) there's now
       a label showing to where the commit goes so

       a branch or trunk (or worse: to a tag) (Stefan)
- ADD: in the "show log" dialog its now possible to
       select two revisions and the context menu then

       before committing (Stefan)

       like ? and * too. (Stefan)

       while popup-commands are executed (Stefan)

       shown to the user for adding before the commit
       occurs (Stefan)
- CHG: order in which the files are passed to the diff
       program (Stefan)
- CHG: the icon overlay should now be faster. This 
       affects mostly big directories but smaller ones
       should profit from it too. (Stefan)
- CHG: converted both projects (shell and main part)
       to UNICODE. This to support non-ANSI characters
       both for viewing and entering. This also solves
       Issue 37. (Stefan)

       the icons of the items were gone. (Stefan)
- BUG: the history combo now works as expected (Stefan)
- CHG: in the switch dialog now the 'switch to branch'
       checkbox is removed since the 'update to revision'

- ADD: If the user selects two files then there's now a "Diff"
       entry in the submenu which starts the external diff program
       on those two files. It's not required that the two files
       be under version control - it works on every two files.
       This is a handy and fast way to see the diff. (Stefan)
- ADD: delete and rename command has now an own menu icon (Stefan)
- BUG: the "save as..." dialog didn't show up under NT4 'cause

       or (if not checked) if the contents of the folder 
       should be imported directly to the url. (Stefan)
- ADD: if the user selects a directory for "Add" then
       a dialog shows up showing all unversioned items
