       indicates that. (Stefan)
- CHG: The 'recursive' checkbox is now disabled when the property page is
       shown for files since there the recursive option doesn't make sense
       anyway. (Stefan)

       dialog, but not committed even if checked. (Stefan)
- BUG: When comparing a file with both local and remote modifications in the
       "check for modifications" dialog the BASE was used instead of the 
       working copy file. (Stefan)
- BUG: Searching in the log dialog for changed paths only worked the first
       time. Subsequent searches produced a result off by one. (Stefan)

- BUG: if more than one file or filemask were ignored, the parent folder was
       added to the list every time instead of just once. (Stefan)

       for each entry anymore. (Stefan)
- CHG: Updated TortoisePlink to Plink Version 0.56. (Stefan)

       illegal values. (Stefan)

       like before. (Stefan)
- ADD: The "check for updates" dialog now shows the
       HEAD revision of the repository. (Stefan)
- ADD: Setting bugtraq: and tsvn: properties recursively
       now makes sure that the properties are only set
       on subfolder and skipped for files, i.e. you
       can set those properties on the /trunk folder with
       the "recursive" checkbox activated and all subfolders
       will have the props set too, without having the files
       set those properties too. (Stefan)
- ADD: When an update is finished, a click on an updated
       file shows a context menu with an entry to compare
       the file in the revision as it was before the update
       with the working copy. (Stefan)
- CHG: improved dialog for creating repositories. (Stefan)
- CHG: The "paste log template in english" setting is now

- CHG: When doing a dry-run merge, after the merge is done
       the merge dialog is shown again with the same settings
       as before so the real merge can be done right away. (Stefan)

- BUG: TortoiseMerge parsed diff files which had binary files
       mentioned in it poorly and could crash. (Stefan)

- CHG: The foldername for which an update is done for is
       shown in the progress dialog title. (Stefan)
- CHG: Temporary files created for diffing retain their 
       original file extensions so that external tools
       can determine the file type for the diff. (Stefan)
- BUG: When an URL to a file was entered in the repository
       browser, it was treated as a folder. (Stefan)
- BUG: Right-drag export of more than one folder made the
       additional folders exported inside the previous
       ones. (Stefan)
- BUG: Authentication when viewing remote properties lead
       to a crash. (Stefan)
- BUG: Even if no entries are added to the right-drag context
       menu, the separator was still added. (Stefan)
- BUG: TortoiseMerge could crash when parsing invalid, corrupted
       or unsupported patchfiles. (Stefan)
- DEV: Patched the libintl library to use the apr-iconv library
       instead of its own iconv library. Those libs are basically
       the same, and with that patch we save 800KB for the additional
       iconv library. (Stefan)
- DEV: Patched apr-iconv to first check in the modules path for the
       *.so files so we don't get into conflicts with the APR_ICONV_PATH
       environment variable anymore.

       the changed paths. (Stefan)
- CHG: The locatorbar in TME shows the current view range
       with a blue background for better indication. (Stefan)

- ADD: Hitting F5 in the log dialog does the same as the "fetch all"
       button. (Stefan)

       support now spell checking and a thesaurus. (Stefan)
- ADD: Revision numbers can now be entered the same way
       as the command line client. That means you can

- CHG: Many cosmetic changes to the UI. (Stefan)

       once. (Stefan)

       i.e. the logmessage is wrapped at the right
       end of the dialog box. (Stefan)

       copy did not include the changes from the
       working copy! (Stefan)
- BUG: In the Commit and the Add dialog: if a file was
       selected then only the topmost parentfolder was
       automatically selected instead of all intermediant
       parentfolders. (Stefan)
- BUG: Export always used HEAD, even if another revision
       was specified in the dialog. (Stefan)
- BUG: Showing diffs for changed files from the list in
       the log dialog was done with the wrong revisions. (Stefan)
- BUG: When adding files in a directory with svn:externals
       in it already controlled files got shown in
       the add dialog. (Stefan)
- BUG: Some patchfiles were not parsed correctly. (Stefan)

       default application in the commit dialog. (Stefan)
- ADD: By placing a '#' in front of the paths for the
       external diff/merge programs make TSVN use
       it's own program TortoiseMerge. This helps
       users who want to switch easily between
       two different programs. (Stefan)

       default, selectable in the settings dialog. (Stefan)

       and right-click behaved differently. 
       Double-Click tried to fetch the log for 
       a wrong revision. (Luebbe)
- BUG: Fixed a crash if the patchfile to apply contained

       virus scanner. (Stefan)

       working. (Stefan)
- ADD: The commit dialog now shows a busy cursor
       while the status of the working copy files
       is checked. (Stefan)
- BUG: The property page and the repo browser showed
       some garbage characters instead of clean
       Unicode chars. (Stefan)

       be shown wrong in the repository browser. (Stefan)

       for a specific filetype (e.g. *.txt)

       the status of a file or folder could
       not be read. (Stefan)
- BUG: The status strings weren't localized
       in the commit and "Check for Updates"
       dialog. (Stefan)
- BUG: Menu settings could be ignored if 
       the first settings change is to put
       all menu entries in the submenu. If
       any other setting was made first then
       everything was ok. (Stefan)
- BUG: When creating a folder on the repository
       root in the browser the refresh function
       went too far up. (Stefan)
- BUG: If no log entry was selected a right-click
       or a left-click on the message area below
       crashed the log dialog.

       folder were selected for deletion. (Stefan)

       
Version 0.21
- ADD: If multiple targets are selected for
       update the all targets which belong to
       the same repository (have the same uuid)
       are updated to the same revision, no matter
       if another commit happened in between
       those updates. (Stefan)
- ADD: Subversion got a new command: "Blame".
       TSVN has it too :) What it does?
       It shows you for each line in a file
       the revision it was last changed and
       the author (so you can blame a bug
       on that author :). (Stefan)
- ADD: The show log command now only shows
       the last 100 revisions, configurable
       in the settings dialog. A new "Get All"

       messages if needed. (Stefan)

       folder was always the same. (Stefan)
- BUG: Changes made on folders in the repo-
       browser weren't shown (refresh did
       not work). (Stefan)
- BUG: "An invalid argument was encountered"
       in the log-dialog when working only
       with keyboard got fixed. (Stefan)

Version 0.20.2
- BUG: crash bug not fixed in 0.20.1 (one Ctrl-Z
       to remove debugging code too much :)
       (Stefan)
       
Version 0.20.1
- BUG: A crash occured if the ssh settings were
       not empty. (Stefan)

       with the filenames only instead of the
       full filepaths. (Stefan)
- BUG: The status cache wasn't thread-safe and
       also not process-safe. Thanks to Luebbe
       for reminding me. (Stefan)

       and trying to show the subversion
       properties could crash the explorer.
       (Stefan)
- CHG: The context menu is disabled for ".svn"
       directories. (Stefan)
- CHG: The balloon tooltips have now the standard
       color of windows as the background. (Stefan)
- ADD: Branch/Tag is available for single files
       too, not just folders. (Stefan)
- ADD: Several new commands for the repository
       browser. Also a new command in the context
       menu to start the repo browser. (Stefan)
- ADD: If a conflict occurs during an update/merge
       operation you can now just doubleclick on
       the conflicted entry to start the external
       merge program. (Stefan)
- ADD: New option to close the progress window
       automatically after the command is
       finished. (Stefan)

       button. (Stefan)

- BUG: There was a memory leak which made explorer use
       a huge amount of RAM over time. (Stefan)
- BUG: The cache timeout wasn't calculated correctly.
       This lead to wrong icon overlays and needed
       several "F5" to get the right ones. (Stefan)
- CHG: The "rename" command now uses the --force option
       by default so that modified files can be renamed
       too. (Stefan)
- CHG: The log dialog got minimize/maximize buttons. (Stefan)
- ADD: Log messages selectable to copy them to the
       clipboard (with Ctrl-C). Issue 64. (Stefan)

       after updates but also after switch (if the
       revision number after the switch is higher
       than before). (Stefan)
- ADD: The property page is now shown for multiple
       files too (without the information about
       a file, since every file has different
       status, dates, names, ...). This allows
       to set/remove properties on multiple files
       at once. (Stefan)

Version 0.18
- BUG: The repository browser didn't escape the url
       sequences. (Stefan)

       in the log dialog. (Stefan)
- CHG: Removed the limitation for property lengths
       in the property page. (Stefan)

       (Stefan)
- ADD: A new entry in the main settings page can be
       used to tell TSVN to reuse the entered log-message
       in the commit dialog even if the user cancelles
       the dialog. This was a user request. (Stefan)
- ADD: New right-drag command to copy files/folders
       inside a working copy. (Stefan)
- ADD: Ask the user for external programs if none
       is specified in the settings. Also if no WinDiff
       like program is found do a unified diff and show
       that in a text-editor. (Stefan)
- ADD: The context menu layout is configurable from
       the settings dialog. (Stefan)
- ADD: Use of the new prompting providers of subversion,
       this means TSVN now uses more specific dialogs

       where they can't be edited. (Stefan)
- CHG: Follow the drive type settings: don't access
       drives which are not used. (Stefan)
- CHG: If there's nothing to commit, a dialog box
       pops up telling that. After that the main
       dialog is also closed so no more pressing
       "OK" or "Cancel" for nothing. (Stefan)
- CHG: The property page uses the XP visual styles
       on windows XP. (Stefan)

- ADD: The resulting revision number is shown when
       doing commits, copies/tags, ... (Stefan)

       branch/tag. Fixes issue 63. (Stefan)
- ADD: Information about a successful tag in the log
       dialog. (Stefan)
- ADD: Exporting directly from an URL. (Stefan)
       
Version 0.16
- BUG: The "open" command in the repository browser
       was always active, even for URL's which 
       can't be opened. (Stefan)
- BUG: Two more dialogs (Updates and Commit) were
       missing the new subversion statuses. (Stefan)
- BUG: The proxy parameters were stored under the wrong
       key in the registry. (Stefan)
- BUG: In Import, if no temporary files were found
       or all deselected then an error message
       was shown. (Stefan)
- BUG: In the log dialog if more than 500 files were
       changed in a revision then it showed "and 0 more"
       instead of the real remaining files. (Stefan)
- CHG: Changed the behaviour of the Log and Updates
       dialog if a network timeout occured. (Stefan)
- CHG: If the option "recursive overlays" is not set
       then the status for folders is always set to
       "normal" to speed things up a little. (Stefan)
- CHG: Added a timeout to the status cache. This
       is a workaround so that refreshing (pressing
       F5) isn't needed that much. (Stefan)
- CHG: Improved the status caching. (Stefan)
- CHG: if only the properties were modified then
       this is indicated by a "(P only)" in
       the status text in the commit dialog. (Stefan)
- ADD: The column provider uses now it's own status
       cache. (Stefan)
- ADD: Norwegian translation. (Jostein Andersen)

- ADD: New context menu in the "Check for updates"
       dialog: compare with working copy. (Stefan)

       log messages. (Stefan)
- BUG: Wrong error message was shown if the
       external diff viewer could not be
       started. (Stefan)

       menus for showing a diff and updating files
       and folders. (Stefan)
- ADD: The proxy-settings are saved even if they
       are disabled. That way you can enable/disable
       those settings without the need to always
       reenter the data. (Stefan)

Version 0.15
- BUG: right-dragging a single file/folder resulted
       in error message "cannot copy path ... into
       its own child ...". (Stefan)

       memory is available. (Stefan)
- ADD: Select the files you want to delete before
       importing a project. (Stefan)
- ADD: New command "ignore" to set the svn:ignore
       property for selected files. This addition also
       includes the necessary changes for other 
       commands to respect the ignored status of
       subversioned files. This fixes 
       issues 38 and 60. (Stefan)
- ADD: While moving files inside a working copy
       a progress dialog is shown. (Stefan)

Version 0.14
- BUG: A Path inside a local repository wasn't recognized
       as a valid repo path in the repository browser. 
       Fixes Issue 56. (Stefan)
- BUG: Fixed issue 54. (Stefan)
- BUG: The dependency of SHGetFolderPathA in shell32.dll
       is removed so TSVN works again on NT4/Win98. (Stefan)
- BUG: renaming didn't work. (Stefan)
- BUG: The drag'n'drop-handler didn't work. (Stefan)
- BUG: The log for a renamed file/folder was shown
       as two deletes instead of a delete and an add. (Stefan)
- BUG: URL were not escaped. Issue 58. (Stefan)
- CHG: Some icons are changed, some new. (Lübbe)
- CHG: If a file is deleted from the filesystem but not
       removed from version control the icon overlay
       shows the "deleted" icon. (Stefan)
- ADD: In the log dialog a new context menu entry
       for creating a tag from a specific revision.
       This solves issue 53. (Stefan)
- ADD: In the log dialog there's a context menu
       in the list of changed files to show the
       changes you made to that file in that
       revision. Solves issue 55. (Stefan)
- ADD: Added another context menu entry to the
       log dialog for creating a unified diff
       file (patch file) and showing that
       inside an external viewer. (Stefan)
- ADD: revert changes of a specific revision in
       the log dialog. (Stefan)
- ADD: New command to check for updates on the
       server. (Stefan)

Version 0.12.1
- BUG: If an error occurred while executing a command
       in the log dialog the ok button wasn't reenabled
       again. (Stefan)
- BUG: Some with the file:/// prefix paths could crash 
       the repository browser. (Stefan)
- BUG: Fixed typo in the conflict editor hint box. (Stefan)
- CHG: Changed some german translations. (Stefan)
- CHG: The Language Combo in the settings page is
       increased in size for all languages. (Stefan)
- CHG: reorganized the submenu. (Stefan)
- CHG: The installer doesn't contain the debug symbols
       and the crashhandler anymore. They can be downloaded
       separately. (Stefan)
- ADD: The About dialog shows which version of TSVN is
       installed (UNICODE or MBCS) in the window title. (Stefan)
- ADD: A new command which starts the default browser
       with the daily use guide. (Stefan)
              
Version 0.12
- BUG: hopefully fixed the bug in the repository-
       browser when using paths with four/five
       slashes. (Stefan)
- BUG: fixed some bugs in the repository browser. (Stefan)
- BUG: deselecting a file inside a folder in the
       add dialog lead to deactivation of _all_
       files which started with the same path, even
       if they weren't in the same folder. (Stefan)
- BUG: menu entries were shown twice for "link" files
       like .lnk and .rdp. This solves issue 52. (Stefan)
- BUG: the merge function wasn't working correctly since
       no revisions were used. (Stefan)
- CHG: the log command now has the strict-option
       set to false instead of true. (Stefan)
- CHG: time/date is now shown using the local
       format. This solves issue 49. (Stefan)
- CHG: removed dependency to msimg32.dll. (Stefan)
- CHG: the commit dialog shows the modified files
       with path. (Stefan)
- CHG: the rename dialog allows only to rename and
       not to move anymore. To move files do a right
       drag in explorer. (Stefan)
- CHG: in the show-log dialog only the first 50
       files that were changed are listed to reduce
       memory consumption. (Stefan)
- ADD: repository browser works with svn://
       svn+ssl:// (Stefan)
- ADD: enhanced the repository browser with a
       popup-menu containing commands like
       "show log", "save as..." and "open". (Stefan)
- ADD: new menu entry to start an external merge
       program, including parameters. (Stefan)
- ADD: the "temporary file mask" can now contain
       folders (marked with a backslash at the end)
       and has a positive list (marked with a 
       plus sign "+" in front). So you are now
       able to specify something like
       "+readme.txt;*.txt;cvs\" which will allow
       the file readme.txt but deny all other *.txt
       files, and will deny all folders and files within
       a folder named "cvs". 
       Please note that the order is from left
       to right - so "*.txt;+readme.txt" will deny
       all *.txt files, the readme.txt will also
       be denied since it has lower priority than
       the *.txt match. (Stefan)
- ADD: before doing a merge TSVN checks if the
       working copy has uncommitted changes
       and shows an error message if it has. (Stefan)
- ADD: if a file has been deleted in the explorer but
       not in version control then the commit dialog
       lets the user select those files and they
       will be deleted from version control before
       the commit. (Stefan)
- ADD: better caching of subversion statuses. (Stefan)
- ADD: two new icon overlays for status "deleted"
       and for status "added". (Stefan)
- ADD: new command "relocate". (Stefan)

Version 0.11.2
- BUG: entering the settings page without
       activating the icon overlay page
       resulted in complete loss of 
       overlay settings if other changes
       were saved. (Stefan)
- BUG: in our own caching provider the
       username/password wasn't initialized
       on the first attempt - this lead to
       undetermined behaviour and crashes!
       (Stefan)
- CHG: some minor GUI changes in the property
       page for the explorer, according to
       the hint from Dimentiy. (Stefan)
- CHG: the url in the property page is no
       longer compacted. (Stefan)

Version 0.11.0
- BUG: if all files were deselected in the commit
       dialog then the progress dialog couldn't be
       closed anymore. (Stefan)
- BUG: Resizing of dialogs didn't work correctly
       so I changed the resizing system (Stefan)
- BUG: corrected tooltip in the checkout dialog (Stefan)
- BUG: for network paths TSVN created a file:// path
       with five instead of four slashes. (Stefan)
- CHG: Repository browser now has a minimal size
       so that resizing works better. (Stefan)
- CHG: if the checkout directory is left empty
       then the OK button is now disabled (Stefan)
- CHG: if no valid path is given then the
       repository browser opens now on the
       desktop by default. (Stefan)
- CHG: unified interface elements. Issue 45. (Stefan)
- CHG: made the menu entries align with others. (Stefan)
- CHG: the menu icons are still ownerdrawn, but
       if the registry entry 
       (DWORD)HKCU\Software\TortoiseSVN\OwnerdrawnMenus
       is set to 0 (zero) then TortoiseSVN uses
       the system to draw the icons. (Stefan)       
- ADD: Translation to russian language added (Dimentiy).
- ADD: in the property page it's now possible to
       select and copy/paste the information. This
       fixes issue 46. (Stefan)
- ADD: After creating a repository now a messagebox
       appears to inform the user of the finished
       command. (Stefan)
- ADD: new menu entry in the log dialog: it's now
       possible to "update to revision" with a
       right click on a specific revision log
       entry. Issue 44. (Stefan)
- ADD: the about box now contains the version
       of subversion TortoiseSVN is linked
       against. Issue 43. (Stefan)
- ADD: TSVN now has it's own caching provider.
       That means that username/password are
       cached during an active session, i.e.
       as long as a dialog is open. This prevents
       the user from entering username/password
       multiple times in the repository browser. (Stefan)
- ADD: the repository browser now always shows
       the full path so the user can select
       elements "above" the one initially entered.
       This fixes issue 47 (but not with an "up"
       button). (Stefan)
       
Version 0.10.0
- BUG: if several files are selected for committing
       and the first one is unversioned or just
       added a crash occured (Stefan)
- BUG: if a folder was renamed in a working copy
       with a system rename (not a 'svn rename')
       then explorer crashed. Issue 39. (Stefan)
- BUG: if an error occured while reading the
       config file it wasn't reported. (Stefan)
- BUG: the settings page crashed if not all pages
       were selected before hitting "ok". (Stefan)
- BUG: copy/paste and drag'n'drop of unversioned
       files could crash explorer. (Stefan)
- BUG: import with "use foldername as modulename"
       didn't work, the modulename was some random
       characters. (Stefan)
- BUG: The check for temporary files when doing an
       import wasn't able to delete those. (Stefan)
- BUG: The disk drive now shouldn't be scanned
       anymore if (in the settings) the icon
       overlays for removable drives is turned off.
       (Stefan)
- BUG: Pathnames weren't correctly converted for
       checkouts. (Stefan)
- ADD: in the settings page there's now an option
       if the user wants to have unversioned files
       shown before a commit so (s)he can add it
       before the commit. (Stefan)
- ADD: the add dialog now shows the files with
       the relative path so the user can better
       check if a file needs to be added or not.
       This is especially usefull if folders
       are added. (Stefan)
- ADD: Two new column providers: one for the URL
       of subversion files/folders and the other
       for a shortened URL without the server
       and file part. (Stefan)
- ADD: new icons (Luebbe)
- CHG: before obtaining a subversion status we
       now first check if an .svn directory
       exists - this should speed up things
       a little. (Stefan)
- CHG: In the commit dialog the focus is now
       set to the edit control where the user
       enters the log message. (Stefan)
- CHG: adjusted the messagebox colors to system
       colors. (Stefan)
- CHG: The green color in the progress dialog
       got replaced with the system color for
       selection background. The red color is
       still hardcoded - I think users who set
       the dialog background to red are crazy
       anyway :) (Stefan)
- CHG: exchanged positions of the ok and 
       cancel button on popular request (Stefan).

Version 0.9.2
- BUG: In the Add dialog unversioned folders
       with items in it lead to a crash (Stefan)
- BUG: removed the unused "Help" button from the 
       settings page (Stefan)
- BUG: The coloring in the progress dialog was wrong 
       if the wc contained svn:externals (Stefan)
- BUG: TortoiseSVN wasn't working on Win98-based
       systems anymore 'cause we now use UNICODE.
       So changed the code to compile for either
       MBCS _or_ UNICODE. This means we have
       to provide two binary versions of TSVN 
       from now on (Stefan)
- CHG: The menu items now are properly aligned
       for both with and without icons (Stefan)
- CHG: merge/tag uses again an url->url copy
       command instead of a wc->url copy since
       this doesn't work for working copy root
       folders. (Stefan)

Version 0.9.1
- BUG: the zlib dll lead to some crashes, so
       I went back to statically linked zlib (Stefan)
- BUG: The prompt dialog for log messages wasn't
       resized properly. (Stefan)
- BUG: The check for temp files was case aware (Stefan)
       
Version 0.9 (Subversion 0.21, rev 5631)
- BUG: in some dialog the repository browser button
       was disabled (Stefan)
- BUG: the "show log" menu was shown even if there
       were multiple files selected (Stefan)
- BUG: icon overlays weren't shown correctly if only
       the properties changed (Stefan)
- BUG: revision numbers weren't correct for HEAD (Stefan)
- BUG: workaround for strange apr behaviour when 
       opening a file with WRITE|CREATE (Stefan)

       as modulename" checkbox (Stefan)
- BUG: repository browser now works for https URLs (Stefan)
- BUG: import and commit log messages were limited
       in number of lines (Stefan)
- BUG: files matching the temporary extensions were
       not added even if the user explicitely selected
       them for adding. (Stefan)
- BUG: The folder icon overlay dissapeared if the
       svn:ignored property was set and an ignored
       file was in the folder (Stefan)
- ADD: in the commit dialog (logprompt) there's now
       a label showing to where the commit goes so
       the user can see if (s)he committing to
       a branch or trunk (or worse: to a tag) (Stefan)
- ADD: in the "show log" dialog its now possible to
       select two revisions and the context menu then
       allows to compare those two revisions (Stefan)
- ADD: browse button for merge dialog (Stefan)
- ADD: log messages now have a list of the changed/added
       removed and moved files added (Stefan)
- ADD: tooltips for import and checkout dialog (Stefan)

       prompt if (s)he wants to save it or not (Stefan)
- ADD: if import or commit get interrupted 'cause of
       an error the log message is preserved (Stefan)
- ADD: a doubleclick on the file list in the commit
       dialog starts the external diff program so you
       can see the changes you made to the files
       before committing (Stefan)
- ADD: The temporary file mask now can have wildcards
       like ? and * too. (Stefan)
- ADD: Icon overlays can now be disabled for different
       drive types (Stefan)
- CHG: the ok button is disabled in the show log dialog
       while popup-commands are executed (Stefan)
- CHG: when committing, only files in versioned dirs are
       shown to the user for adding before the commit
       occurs (Stefan)
- CHG: order in which the files are passed to the diff
       program (Stefan)
- CHG: the icon overlay should now be faster. This 
       affects mostly big directories but smaller ones
       should profit from it too. (Stefan)
- CHG: converted both projects (shell and main part)
       to UNICODE. This to support non-ANSI characters
       both for viewing and entering. This also solves
       Issue 37. (Stefan)
- CHG: the temp file mask is now stored under HKCU
       instead of HKLM (Stefan)

Version 0.8.1
- BUG: the add menu was missing for single files (Stefan)
- BUG: the "update to revision" command updated always to HEAD
       (Stefan)
- BUG: if the user selected unversioned items for updating
       then TSVN could crash (Stefan)
- BUG: in the copy dialog the error message from subversion
       was not shown (only the beep was heard). (Stefan)
- BUG: if the user pressed "Cancel" in the authentication
       dialog then still another retry was made (Stefan)
- BUG: if the URL in the combobox was deleted then the
       repository browser button was disabled forever. (Stefan)
- BUG: if the repository browser was used a second time then
       the icons of the items were gone. (Stefan)
- BUG: the history combo now works as expected (Stefan)
- CHG: in the switch dialog now the 'switch to branch'
       checkbox is removed since the 'update to revision'
       command does exactly this. (Stefan)
- CHG: the copy command now uses the progess dialog (Stefan)
- CHG: use always wc->url in copy command (Stefan)
- ADD: the progress dialog now shows the different actions
       in color. Also it now shows directly if during an
       update a file gets conflicted or merged. (Stefan)

- ADD: the branch/tag dialog now shows from which URL the
       branch/tag is made. (Stefan)
- ADD: a 'browse repository' button in the switch dialog (Stefan)
- ADD: "show log" now in the TSVN submenu too (Stefan)

Version 0.8
- CHG: most used commands are now in the top context menu and
       not in the submenu anymore (Stefan)
- CHG: Modified the SVN Progress dialog so that the columns are
       resized before any data is added. Also ensured that all
       items are *entirely* visible even if the horizontal scroll
       bar is visible. (Damian)

- ADD: drag and drop handler for adding files to a working copy
       and for moving files inside a working copy (Stefan)

       Modified the initial value of the checkout directory field
       contain the current working directory (InitInstanceMade
       method of the CTortoiseProcApp class). (Damian)
- ADD: If the user selects two files then there's now a "Diff"
       entry in the submenu which starts the external diff program
       on those two files. It's not required that the two files
       be under version control - it works on every two files.
       This is a handy and fast way to see the diff. (Stefan)
- ADD: delete and rename command has now an own menu icon (Stefan)
- BUG: the "save as..." dialog didn't show up under NT4 'cause
       of the changed size of OPENFILENAME structure (Stefan)

       explorer (Stefan)
- ADD: in the import dialog it's now possible to specify if
       the foldername should be used as the new module name
       or (if not checked) if the contents of the folder 
       should be imported directly to the url. (Stefan)
- ADD: if the user selects a directory for "Add" then
       a dialog shows up showing all unversioned items
       recursively in that folder. (Stefan)

       are now shown in reverse order like the normal log dialog.
       (Stefan)

       get greater compatibility with other diff programs. (Stefan)
- ENH: the repository browser now uses the correct icons from the
       system icon list for folders and files. (Stefan)
- ADD: after an update of a working copy a "show log..." button
       is shown which will (if pressed) get the logs for the
       revisions since the last update. (Stefan)

Version 0.5.1 (Subversion rev: 4753)
- BUG: the width and height of the context menu is now calculated
       correctly according to the length of the string and the
       selected system font. (Stefan)
- BUG: columnprovider crashed for unversioned files inside a working
       copy. (Stefan)
- BUG: committing of several selected files resulted in several
       separate commits instead of only one. (Stefan)
- BUG: the modulename in checkout was ignored. (Stefan)
- ENH: resizable dialogs now have a resize grip on the bottom right
       corner to show the user that they are resizable. (Stefan)
- ADD: a diff command exists now in the context menu for comparing
       the changes to the text-base (changes since last commit).
       (Stefan)
- ADD: when doing a commit TSVN now determines first which files
       need a commit and let the user select which of these
       are actually needed for a commit. This makes it also easier
       to write log messages since its visible which files have
       changed. (Stefan)
       
Version 0.5
- BUG: two separators could appear together in submenu (Tim)
- BUG: changed the projects to using the berkeley db
       built with VC.NET instead of VC6.
       This inconsistency caused heap corruption when accessing

       access. (Stefan)
- BUG: the "browse for external diff program" dialog wouldn't
       show up 'cause the stringbuffer must be initialized to zero

       multiple menu entries. (Stefan)
- BUG: selecting a link and choosing "properties" caused explorer 
       to crash. (Stefan)
- BUG: when no status of a file could be obtained (wc locked, ...)
       then the commands copy, merge and switch crashed. (Stefan)

       throws an error) then the command "compare with working copy"
       would crash. (Stefan)

       (Stefan)
- BUG: renaming files didn't work (via menu, not via changewatcher)
       Issue 12 (Stefan)

- BUG: hopefully fixed the icon spacing in the submenu (modelled it
       on the new menu in windows. (Tim)
- CHG: made the required API changes in the authentication subversion
       uses. (Stefan)
- ENH: issue #4 done. Urls have now a dropdown combobox with the
       last entered values. (Stefan)
- ENH: issue 10 done. Save revision of a file now works in the
       log dialog from the context menu. (Stefan)
- ENH: issue 2: update to a specific revision is now possible through
       the shift-right-click context menu. Then the command "update"
       changes to "update to revision...". (Stefan)
- ENH: issue #6 done. you can now sepcify a revision in the checkout 
       dialog (Tim)
- ADD: issue #7 done. You can now browse the local filesystem for a 
       local repository. You can also browse a repository (local and 
       remote) for paths (Tim)
- ADD: the settings dialog contains now a page for proxy settings.
       (Stefan)
- ADD: two new column providers: one for the revision number and
       the second overrides the predefined "author" column. (Stefan)
- ADD: added browse button to the Import dialog. You can now browse 
       the local filesystem for a local repository. You can also 
       browse a repository (local and remote) for paths. (Tim)

Version 0.4
