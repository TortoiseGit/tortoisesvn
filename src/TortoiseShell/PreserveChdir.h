/**
 * \ingroup TortoiseShell
 * Helper class to keep the current directory.
 * When created, the current directory is saved and restored
 * as soon as the object is destroyed.
 * Since some of the SVN functions change the current directory
 * which when in the explorer process space causes problems / crashs,
 * this class is used to reset the current directory after calling
 * those functions.
 *
 * \par requirements
 * win95 or later
 * winNT4 or later
 *
 * \version 1.0
 * first version
 *
 * \par license
 * This code is absolutely free to use and modify. The code is provided "as is" with
 * no expressed or implied warranty. The author accepts no liability if it causes
 * any damage to your computer, causes your pet to fall ill, increases baldness
 * or makes your car start emitting strange noises when you start it up.
 * This code has no bugs, just undocumented features!
