		<p> TortoiseSVN is a really easy-to-use version control / source control client under a GPL license, i.e it's free! <br />
		    Since it's not an integration for a <em>specific</em> IDE you can use it with whatever development tools you like. </p>

		<h3>Features of TortoiseSVN/Subversion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Windows Shell (Explorer) integration. Can be used without any IDE.</li>
            <li> Icon overlays show immediately which files/folders need to be uploaded (committed) to the database.</li>
            <li> Easy to use dialogs for version control operations.</li>
            <li> The UI is available in different languages. </li>
            <li> Global revision numbers. You can get old versions of your <em>project</em> and not just single files.</li>
