                    It is linked against Subversion 1.7.2

                    <p>
                    Again a lot of bugs have been fixed, both in TortoiseSVN
                    itself and the underlying Subversion library.

                    It's only been a few days since we released 1.7.0, but in this

                    <p>
                    It's been two and a half year, 935 days to be exact since 
                    version 1.6 was released. The TortoiseSVN repository 
                    counts 6213 commits since then, which results in about 6 
                    commits per day.

                    <p>
                    With that many changes done to TortoiseSVN alone, and much
                    more to the Subversion core itself you can expect a lot of
                    improvements. We've listed the most obvious and visible 
                    improvements in the

                    <p>Windows 8 (or whatever its name will be when it's released)
                    will have a new feature where the Aero colors can be 
                    <a href="http://www.withinwindows.com/2011/04/06/windows-8-secrets-aero-auto-colorization/">
                    automatically adjusted according to the selected wallpaper</a>.</p>
                    <p>This seems to be a nice feature, and there's even a tool available
                    that offers that feature for Windows 7: <a href="http://aura.codeplex.com/">Aura</a>.</p>
                    <p>But there are some things about Aura that bother me, so I hacked together
                    my own tool which offers that feature.</p>
                    <p>Unlike Aura, AAClr is written in plain C++ and doesn't 
                    use the .NET framework. For tools that are supposed to be started
                    automatically on logon, this ensures that the whole startup time
                    doesn't increase by several seconds.</p>
                    <p>AAClr also detects changes in wallpapers by catching events
                    from the system and doesn't use timers that access the wallpaper file
                    several times a second (like Aura does). That means that AAClr is idle
                    most of the time and only wakes up when necessary.</p>
                    <p>And about resource usage: AAClr uses less than 2MB of 
                    private bytes - I think that's not too much.</p>
                    <p>The link to the download can be found on the <a href="http://tools.tortoisesvn.net/AAClr.html">project page</a>.</p>

                    There's now a <a href="http://link.packtpub.com/qcmkxs">book</a> available about TortoiseSVN. Of course, 
                    there are books about Subversion which mention TortoiseSVN.
                    But this is (I think) the first book about TortoiseSVN.

                    <p>
                    Full disclosure: I was asked to <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/author_reviewing_for_packt">review</a>
                    the book, which I did. And I'm mentioned as a reviewer in
                    the book! So I had to write something about it here since
                    I was never mentioned in a book before :).

                    read my <a href="beginnersguide.html" class="permalink">full post</a> about this book.
