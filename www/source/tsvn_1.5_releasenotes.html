                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.5 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases,
                and is considered the current stable and "best" release. Anything in 1.0.x,
                1.1.x, 1.2.x, 1.3.x or 1.4.x is also in 1.5, but 1.5 contains features and
                bugfixes not present in any earlier release.</p>

                <h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

                <p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.5
                servers and clients. Of course, some of the new 1.5 features may not
                be available unless both client and server are the latest version.
                See the table below about which features require which versions:</p>

                </p>


                <p>Due to certain improvements made to the working copy
                library, the version number of the working copy format has been
                incremented. This means that Subversion clients earlier than 1.5 will
                <em>not</em> be able to work with working copies produced by Subversion
                1.5. Similarly, the repository format has changed as well, meaning
                that pre-1.5 Subversion tools that normally access a repository
                directly
                (e.g. <code>svnserve</code>, <code>mod_dav_svn</code>, <code>svnadmin</code>)
                won't be able to read a repository originally created by Subversion 1.5.
                </p>

                <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> if a Subversion 1.5 client encounters a pre-1.5
                working copy, it will <em>automatically</em> upgrade the working copy
                format as soon as it touches it, making it unreadable by older
                Subversion clients. If you are using several versions of Subversion
                on your machine, you need to be careful about which version you use in
                which working copy, to avoid accidentally upgrading the working copy
                format. This "auto upgrade" feature, however, does <em>not</em> occur
                with the new repository format.
                </p>

                <p>
                Have a look at the Subversion FAQ about the
                <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#working-copy-format-change">

            <div class="post" id="merge-tracking">
                <h2>Merge Tracking</h2>

                <p>Merge Tracking in Subversion 1.5.0 is roughly equivalent in
                functionality to <a
                href="http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py">svnmerge.py</a>,
                recording and using merge history to avoid common cases of the
                <a href="#repeated-merge">repeated merge</a> problem, and allowing for cherry-picking of changes.
                It exposes merge history via properties, and allows for repository
                dump/load (including the ability to re-create the merge history
                index).</p>

                <p>Note: Some merge tracking features can't be used for repositories served
                by pre-1.5.x servers.</p>

                <div class="h3" id="repeated-merge">
                <h3>Repeated Merge</h3>

                <p>When working on a branch, Subversion now tracks each revision which
                gets merged. This makes it easier to merge changes e.g., from trunk
                because it is possible to always merge the whole revision range without
                the risk of merging the same revision twice. Subversion will automatically
                omit the already merged revisions when doing the merge.</p>

                <img src="img/LogWithGrayedMerge.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Log dialog showing already
                merged entries grayed out">

                <p>When showing the log from the merge dialog to find the revisions to
                merge, TortoiseSVN shows the already merged revisions grayed out as
                a visual hint. If a grayed out revision is selected, Subversion does
                not merge that revision again because it was already merged.</p>

                </div>  <!-- repeated-merge -->

                <div class="h3" id="manual-merge">
                <h3>Record Manual Merge</h3>

                <p>To block a revision from being merged, TortoiseSVN provides a button
                in the merge dialog named "record only". This will tell Subversion that
                the revision has already been merged, without doing the merge itself.</p>

                </div>  <!-- manual-merge -->

                <div class="h3" id="merge-info">
                <h3>Merge Information</h3>

                <p>When inspecting revisions with the log dialog, the messages of revisions
                where a merge occurred aren't usually very useful. Most people write
                log messages in the form "merged revisions XXX to YYY from /branches/ZZZ"
                or something similar. But what's really interesting when examining the
                log of a folder/file would be the log messages of all the revisions
                that got merged.</p>

                <img src="img/LogWithoutMerge.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Log dialog showing entries
                without merge history">

                <p>TortoiseSVN can show you those log messages if you want. The log dialog
                has a checkbox which when activated will fetch all the log messages of
                merged revisions. The log entries of merged revisions are shown a little
                indented.</p>

                <h2>Sparse checkouts</h2>

                <p>Many users have very large trees of which they only want to checkout
                certain parts. In case of folders with many subfolders, some of the
                subfolders might not be needed.</p>
                <p>TortoiseSVN provides the user with a combo box to choose the depth
                of a checkout:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Fully recursive</li>
                <li>Immediate children, including folders</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The depth of the checkout is remembered, so that a later <em>update</em>
                will respect that depth and not fetch everything again.</p>

            <div class="post" id="cyrus-sasl">
                <h2>Cyrus SASL support for <code>svnserve</code></h2>

                <p>In Subversion 1.5, svnserve can use SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)
                for authentication and data encryption.
                TortoiseSVN has SASL implemented too. The following SASL authentication
                methods are available with TortoiseSVN 1.5:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>ANONYMOUS</li>
                <li>CRAM-MD5</li>
                <li>PLAIN</li>
                <li>DIGEST-MD5</li>
                <li>LOGIN</li>
                <li>NTLM</li>
                </ul>
                <p>SASL also provides data encryption in some of these methods, so you can secure
                your data while it is being transmitted over the internet. Securing your connection
                using SASL should be easier than setting up an SSH infrastructure.</p>

            <div class="post" id="changelist-support">
                <h2>Changelist support</h2>

                <p>Sometimes you are working on several different problems at once
                in your working copy, and it becomes difficult to track which files are
                involved in which change. TortoiseSVN now allows you to group files together
                into logical <em>changelists</em>. These appear in the Commit dialog and the
                Check for Modifications dialog. As well as giving a visual indication, you
                can also select groups for commit.
                </p>
                <img src="img/ChangeList.png" alt="Commit dialog showing changelists
                grouped together">

                <p>
                TortoiseSVN also provides a special changelist named <em>ignore-on-commit</em>.
                Files which belong to that changelist are <em>not</em> selected in the
                commit dialog. This helps if you have a file which you must keep versioned
                but which you don't want its modifications to get committed.

            <div class="post" id="log-cache">
                <h2>Log Cache</h2>

                <p>Fetching the log information from the repository can take a long
                time, especially for repositories with thousands of revisions or if
                the repository is not on a fast connection.</p>

                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.5 can cache the log entries on the local drive. Only
                the entries which are not yet in the local cache are fetched from the
                repository.</p>

                <p>The log cache improves the performance not only of the log dialog

                <p>The repository browser has been completely rewritten and now more
                resembles the Windows explorer. It has two panes, with a tree
                view on the left and the file/folder list on the right.</p>

                <img src="img/RepositoryBrowser.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Repository Browser">

                <p>Part of the rewrite also includes a performance improvement when

                <p>
                It is also possible to drag files/folders from the repository browser
                directly to the explorer as a fast way to save/export those files/folders.

                <p>The revision graph has changed dramatically since the previous release.
                Apart from using the log cache if available, it is also much faster when
                analyzing the log data.</p>

                <p>A small window on the top right of the graph shows an overview of the
                whole graph.</p>

                <p>The new revision graph has much more options to tweak the output.
                For example, the direction of the graph, how the nodes are arranged in

                The SubWCRev tool now has a COM interface for easy access from scripting

            <div class="post" id="Overlays">
                <h2>Overlay Icons</h2>

                <p>
                If you're using other Tortoise clients like TortoiseCVS you might know
                about the problem with the limited overlay slots in Windows. With both
                TortoiseSVN and TortoiseCVS installed, some of the overlays won't show
                up anymore. This is due to the fact that Windows only has about 12 slots
                available for overlays and with both applications installed, that limit
                is exhausted.
                </p>
                <p>
                To solve this issue, we've implemented a common overlay handler for
                all Tortoise clients to use. With this handler, all Tortoise clients will
                show the same overlay icons and use the same overlay slots. That way
                we won't hit the Windows limit so easily anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                TortoiseSVN 1.5.x and the TortoiseCVS unstable releases already use
                this new overlay handler.
                </p>
                <p>
                Due to this new overlay handler which shares the overlays, TortoiseSVN
                gained two new overlays: for unversioned and ignored files there is now
                an overlay too.
