                    you can integrate TortoiseSVN commands to various context menus.
                    Of course, there are Subversion plugins for Visual Studio,
                    but if you're using one of the free versions of Visual Studio,
                    you can not use those plugins. And sometimes it's
                    still nice to have some of the TortoiseSVN commands
                    available from Visual Studio directly, even if you have

                    So I made another tool: CryptSync.

                    <p>
                    CryptSync is a small utility that synchronizes two folders
                    while encrypting the contents in one folder. That means one
                    of the two folders has all files unencrypted (the files
                    you work with) and the other folder has all the files
                    encrypted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The synchronization works both ways: a change in one folder
                    gets synchronized to the other folder. If a file is added
                    or modified in the unencrypted folder, it gets encrypted.
                    If a file is added or modified in the encrypted folder, it
                    get decrypted to the other folder.

                    <p>Subversion's design is made up so that you will

                    that will do exactly that: <strong>Revert</strong>.<br/>
                    Reverting means discarding all modifications you've
                    made to one or more files which you haven't committed
                    yet.</p>
                    <p>But what if you selected the wrong file(s) to revert?
                    Sure, TortoiseSVN always asks you first before it
                    reverts the files. But as we all know, such &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
                    dialogs are too easily dismissed by clicking &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>

                    <p>The revision graph is a nice way to get a quick
                    overview of your project. However you can not share
                    the graph with other people unless you save it as
                    an image and pass the image on.</p>
                    <p>If the revision graph is small, then saving the
                    graph as a png image will do just fine. But as with
                    all images, a png does not scale very well. And if the
                    revision graph is already big the resulting image file
                    can get quite big as well. It can even get too big

                    my own tool which offers that feature.</p>
                    <p>Unlike Aura, AAClr is written in plain C++ and doesn't
                    use the .NET Framework. For tools that are supposed to be started
                    automatically on logon, this ensures that the whole startup time
                    doesn't increase by several seconds.</p>
                    <p>AAClr also detects changes in wallpapers by catching events
                    from the system and doesn't use timers that access the wallpaper file
                    several times a second (like Aura does). That means that AAClr is idle
                    most of the time and only wakes up when necessary.</p>
                    <p>And about resource usage: AAClr uses less than 2MB of
                    private bytes - I think that's not too much.</p>
                    <p>The link to the download can be found on the <a href="http://stefanstools.sourceforge.net/AAClr.html">project page</a>.</p>

                    There's now a <a href="http://link.packtpub.com/qcmkxs">book</a> available about TortoiseSVN. Of course,
                    there are books about Subversion which mention TortoiseSVN.
                    But this is (I think) the first book about TortoiseSVN.

                    Full disclosure: I was asked to <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/author_reviewing_for_packt">review</a>
                    the book, which I did. And I'm mentioned as a reviewer in
                    the book! So I had to write something about it here since
                    I was never mentioned in a book before :).
                    </p>

                    read my <a href="beginnersguide.html">full post</a> about this book.
