                    <p>We use <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForums.do">mailing lists</a>
                    to discuss everything about TortoiseSVN. Everyone is
                    welcome to join our discussions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How to join the mailing lists</h3>

                    <p>We have two mailing lists for discussions:</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>users list</dt>
                        <dd>
                        <p>This is the list for the users of TortoiseSVN. If
                        you have questions, suggestions or you want to report
                        a bug, join here.</p>
                        <p>To join the users mailing list, send an email to
                        <span class="nobr">users-subscribe@tortoisesvn.tigris.org.</span></p>
                        <p>Or use the
                        <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=4061">Forum</a>
                        to read and post (you need to create a tigris.org
                        account).</p>

                        </dd>
                        <dt>developers list</dt>
                        <dd>
                        <p>Here, the developers discuss technical details about
                        new features. If you want to join the development of
                        TortoiseSVN, join here! This is also the place where
                        users of the <a href="http://nightlybuilds.tortoisesvn.net/">nightly builds</a>
                        report issues.</p>
                        <p><strong>If you're not sure about where you should join,
                        use the users list instead.</strong></p>
                        <p>To join the developers mailing list, send an email
                        to <span class="nobr">dev-subscribe@tortoisesvn.tigris.org.</span></p>
                        <p>Or use the
                        <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=757">Forum</a>
                        to read and post.</p>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>Note: if your posts to the lists get rejected even if
                    you're subscribed, you have to create an account on
                    <a href="http://www.tigris.org">tigris.org</a> and assign
                    the email address from which you're posting to that account.
                    In some situations it might even be necessary that you
                    request the "observer" role in the TortoiseSVN project on
                    tigris.org. We know the problems, and the guys at
                    tigris.org are working on it.</p>

                    <h3>Mailing List Etiquette</h3>
                    <p>A little bit of common sense should make it unnecessary
                    to place this etiquette here, but since many people don't
                    seem to know some basic rules...</p>

                    <p>Here they are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Answers go only to the mailing-list. Do not answer
                        to people directly.</li>
                        <li>Don't mail the project owners directly. We are
                        going to ditch these mails.</li>
                        <li>Answer below the quote.</li>
                        <li>Delete unnecessary text (signatures) in the quote.</li>
                        <li>No full quoting. Keep just enough of the original
                        text so that others can see the questions you are
                        answering.</li>
                        <li>If you want to change to a different topic, create
                        a new thread. Don't just answer another message and
                        replace the subject.</li>
                        <li>No big (larger than 50kB) attachments. Screenshots
                        are ok, but send them as jpeg's or png's. Some people
                        sent us screenshots in a WORD document (!) - don't
                        expect anyone to even open such a document.</li>
                        <li>Don't ask for mail receipts.</li>
                        <li>Don't send "out-of-office" replies or other
                        autoresponder messages to the list.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Mailing list archives</h3>
                    <p>before you start asking question on the mailing lists,
                    you should first search the mailing list archives. There's
                    a big chance that you're not the first one with that
                    question, and it might already been answered before.</p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>users list</dt>
                        <dd>either search on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tortoisesvn">Google Group</a> or the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=4061">tigris.org</a> websites.</dd>

                    <p>Note: Messages on the Google Group have options to
                    <em>Reply</em> or <em>Reply to Author</em>.
                    Please do <strong>not</strong> use the <em>Reply to Author</em> option
                    as it will not get back to the mailing list and may
                    simply be deleted. Some older posts do not have a
                    standard <em>Reply</em> option. In that case you should at
                    least add a <em>CC</em> to our mailing list
                    <span class="nobr">(users at tortoisesvn dot tigris dot org).</span></p>

                    <h3>Professional Support</h3>
                    <p>A lot of companies also offer professional support.
                    Some of them are also active in the development of
                    Subversion itself and have hired developers who work
                    actively on the projects.</p>
                    <p>WANdisco has a support forum for TortoiseSVN,
                    which you can find <a href="http://subversion.wandisco.com/forums/20-tortoisesvn-community-support.html">here</a>.</p>
