                    <p>TortoiseSVN allows you to specify your own tool for
                    showing diffs and/or merges. For example, a lot of people
                    prefer <a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a> over
                    <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/TortoiseMerge.html">TortoiseMerge</a> (
                    even though I can't see why :-) ).</p>

                    <p>But sometimes you might want to prefer TortoiseMerge
                    over your custom diff tool. Changing the settings would be
                    way too complicated to just use TortoiseMerge once, for
                    this particular situation.</p>
                    <p>TortoiseSVN allows you to use TortoiseMerge easily,
                    without changing your custom diff tool setup: just hold
                    down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key when you click on the context menu to
                    do the diff. If the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key is pressed when doing a diff,
                    TortoiseSVN always uses TortoiseMerge. If the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key is
                    not pressed, the diff/merge tool specified in your settings
                    is used.</p>
