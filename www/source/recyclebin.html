                    <p>Subversion's design is made up so that you will
                    never ever lose any data. But there's one command
                    that will do exactly that: <strong>Revert</strong>.<br/>
                    Reverting means discarding all modifications you've
                    made to one or more files which you haven't committed
                    yet.</p>
                    <p>But what if you selected the wrong file(s) to revert?
                    Sure, TortoiseSVN always asks you first before it
                    reverts the files. But as we all know, such &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
                    dialogs are too easily dismissed by clicking &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
                    <p>So what if you reverted files and you then discover
                    that you shouldn't have done that?<br/>
                    If you used TortoiseSVN to revert, you can get the
                    reverted changes back again! Because TortoiseSVN
                    doesn't just revert your files but first moves them to the Windows
                    recycle bin (trash folder).<br/>
                    <img class="img-centered" src="/img/recycle-bin.png" alt="Windows recycle bin" width="96" height="96">
                    <br/>
                    That means your changes aren't lost completely:
                    you can find the files in the Windows recycle bin
                    and restore them from there.</p>
                    <div class="important">
                    <h3>This is optional</h3>
                    <p>
                    Using the recycle bin is optional. In the settings
                    dialog under &quot;Dialogs 1&quot; you can disable
                    this (it's enabled by default) by unchecking the
                    option &quot;Use recycle bin when reverting&quot;
                    </p>
