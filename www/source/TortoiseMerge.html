                        Version control is all about having the history of your working progress.
                        But to really see and check the history, you must be able to see and check
                        what has changed between two points in time, for example what has changed
                        between two releases of your product, or what was changed to fix a bug, or ...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is where TortoiseMerge helps. It is a diff / merge software tool
                        for Windows with a tight integration for TortoiseSVN.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="diff">Diffing files</h3>
                    <p>
                        At least for files which consist of text, TortoiseMerge can help you here.
                        It shows you the two versions of a file side-by-side, coloring every
                        modified line in that file.
                    </p>
                    <a href="/img/TMerge_TwoPane.png" class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="merge" title="TMerge_TwoPane">
                        <img src="/img/TMerge_TwoPane-small.png" alt="TMerge_TwoPane" width="364" height="277">
                    </a>
                    <p>
                        You can see in that screenshot that TortoiseMerge also colors the changes
                        <em>inside</em> modified lines so you can see immediately what exactly
                        has changed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you reformat your code or text, sometimes you don't really change
                        anything but only split a long line into multiple ones, or you merge
                        multiple lines into one. TortoiseMerge marks such changes with a white
                        circle on the left gray bar of each view. If you see such a white
                        circle, you know that no real changes were made, only changes in
                        <em>whitespaces</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the bottom of the window, there is a view showing the two lines your
                        mouse pointer is currently hovering over. It always shows whitespace characters
                        with special chars, and of course it's very handy if you have long lines
                        because that view has the double width than the normal views.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="merge">Resolving conflicts</h3>
                    <p>
                        But that's not all TortoiseMerge is able to do for you. It can also help
                        you resolve a conflict by showing you <em>your</em> file, the file which
                        has been modified by <em>someone else</em> and the file as it was before
                        any of you have modified it, in its <em>original</em> state. Then you can
                        easily see where the changes made conflict, and you can choose how to
                        resolve that conflict.

                    <h3 id="patch">Applying patch files</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you're working on a project and other people have access to your
                        source code, but not necessarily have the rights to commit changes to
                        the repository, you sometimes get a patch file with a bug fix or an
                        enhancement. TortoiseMerge helps here too, because it can apply those
                        patchfiles for you.
                    </p>
                    <a href="/img/ApplyPatchMenu.png" class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="merge" title="ApplyPatchMenu">
                        <img src="/img/ApplyPatchMenu-small.png" alt="ApplyPatchMenu" width="164" height="84">
                    </a>
                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        On the left is a small window containing all files which the patchfile
                        wants to modify. A doubleclick on those file entries opens the file
                        to be patched on the left, and the file how it looks like after the
                        patch is applied on the right side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To approve the patch, saving the file is enough.
