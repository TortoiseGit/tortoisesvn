    <div class="entry">
        <p>Since the TortoiseSVN MSI installer files are hosted on
        many <a href="https://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>
        mirrors, we can't guarantee that they are not modified or
        corrupted when you download them.</p>
        <p>To verify that the files have not been tempered with,
        you can verify the signature of the files yourself. All
        files of TortoiseSVN are digitally signed
        (since version 1.6.3).</p>
        <p>After downloading the files, right-click on the files
        and choose "Properties" from the explorer context menu.
        In the properties dialog, go to the "signatures" tab and
        verify that the file is signed by <em>Open Source Developer, Stefan KUENG</em> and that
        the signature is valid. If you don't see the "signatures"
        tab, you don't have a good file!</p>

        </a>

        <p>Windows also verifies the signature during installation.
        If the prompt dialog does not say that the signature is
        valid, cancel the installation and download the file
        again!</p>
