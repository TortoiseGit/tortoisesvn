Dear Stefan Kueng,

Thanks for contacting PayPal with concerns. This is Belena from PayPal
Compliance Department and I will take care of your case in future. 

After discussion with policy team, we decided to allow you keep using this
PayPal account if you send us one email and promises not to use PayPal to
solicit donations further. 

Please understand PayPal Private Limited is unable to process payments for
non-registered charities and non-profit organizations (NPOs), political
party/organizations, religious institutions, personal/organizational
fundraisers, etc. in countries under its jurisdiction.

You may send email to apacdd@paypal.com.

Your assistance and expediency in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
Belena
PayPal Compliance Department
PayPal, an eBay Company
