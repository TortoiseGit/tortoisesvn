					<p>Fetching the log for slow or very big repositories can
					take quite a while. And of course, it requires you to be
					connected to the repository. You can't show the log
					messages if you're not online - very annoying if the
					network is down or you're in a place where you don't even
					have network access.</p>

					<p>To at least partly solve this issue, TortoiseSVN 1.5 can
					cache the log messages from Subversion repositories. The
					feature is implemented transparently, which means you won't
					have to do anything to make this work. All you might notice
					is that once you showed all log messages for your
					repository, the next time the log dialog is a lot faster.</p>

					<p>If you want to test this, you can show the log for the
					<a href="http://tortoisesvn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/">TortoiseSVN repository</a>.
					Click on the "Show all" button in the log dialog to get all
					log messages. You will notice that it takes a while to
					fetch all messages. If you then close the log dialog and
					start it again for the same URL, you can click the "Show all"
					button and all messages are fetched from the log cache.</p>

					<p>In case you can't connect to the repository, the log
					dialog will show you a dialog where you can choose to
					"work offline", i.e., it won't try to connect to the
					repository anymore but only use the cache:<br/>
					<a href="images/logoffline.png" rel="lightbox[loguuids]"><img src="images/logoffline-small.png"></a>.
					</p>

					<p>However, there is one problem: the log cache relies
					upon all your repositories having different UUIDs assigned
					to them.<br/>You can see the UUID of your repositories if
					you have a working copy of them in the properties dialog
					(Explorer context menu 'properties'):<br/>
					<a href="images/repouuid.png" rel="lightbox[loguuids]"><img src="images/repouuid-small.png"></a>.
					<br/>
					The log cache needs the UUID to distinguish between
					different repositories which of course have different log
					messages. The reason the log cache can't use URLs alone to
					distinguish between repositories is that URLs just don't
					provide that information.</p>

					<p>For example, an URL like</p>
					<p><em>http://example.com/svn/trunk</em></p>
					<p>would clearly indicate that the repository is located
					at <em>http://example.com/svn</em>. Because we can assume
					that 'svn' is not a project name.</p>

					<p>But an URL like</p>
					<p><em></em><em>http://example.com/svn/project/trunk</em><br/>
					could mean that it points to a repository for 'project',
					but it could also mean that there's only one repository at
					'svn' and 'project' is just a folder inside that repository.
					So the two URLs<br/><em>http://example.com/svn/project/trunk</em><br/>
					and<br/><em>http://example.com/svn/otherproject/trunk</em><br/>
					could be pointing to the same repository, or to two
					different repositories.</p>

					<p>That's why the log cache must rely on the repository
					UUIDs to be different for every repository.</p>

					<p>Now, some people made the mistake of creating new
					repositories by simply copying a default (empty) repository.
					By doing that, all repositories have the same UUID! Yes,
					this is a big mistake: it's called UUID for a reason: the
					'U' stands for "Unique". This will confuse the log cache
					completely and you will get the crash report dialog showing
					up a lot.<br/>To fix this, you have to set a unique UUID
					for every one of your repositories. Get the svnadmin tool
					from the official Subversion package and run:</p>

					<p>svnadmin setuuid REPOS_PATH</p>
					<p>on every one of your repositories.</p>

					<p>In case you don't have direct access to your
					repositories or you can't change the UUID for some other
					reason, you can disable the log cache in the TortoiseSVN
					settings dialog:<br/>
					<a href="images/logcachesettings.png" rel="lightbox[loguuids]"><img src="images/logcachesettings-small.png"></a>.
					</p>
					<p>In the above screenshot, you may notice the option
					"Allow ambiguous URLs". Now that I've told you that the
					cache relies upon the UUIDs being different, why does it
					also rely on URLs?<br/>Comparing URLs (i.e., simple
					strings) is much faster than asking the repository or
					the working copy for the repository UUID. So the cache
					uses URLs too if possible. For example, if the cache knows
					that the URL<br/><em>http://example.com/svn/project/trunk</em><br/>
					points to a specific repository, it also knows that the
					URL<br/><em>http://example.com/svn/project/trunk/subfolder</em><br/>
					points to the very same repository, since it's not possible
					to have a repository inside a repository.</p>
					<p>The option "Allow ambiguous URLs" is for situations where
					the same URL is used for different repositories - those
					situations are very rare of course. One situation we ran
					into problems was with
					<a href="http://codeplex.com/SvnBridge">svnbrigde</a>.
					That's a nice tool which allows you to access MS Team System
					repositories with an svn client. But older versions of that
					tool made all repositories accessible for svn clients at the
					same URL.<br/>Once we discussed the issue with the
					svnbridge developers, they had a version ready in almost no
					time which provided different URLs for the different Team
					System repositories. So with the latest version of
					svnbridge, you should not run into that problem. But if
					you can't update your version of svnbridge for some reason,
					you have to activate the option "Allow ambiguous URLs".</p>
