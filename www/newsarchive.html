				<div class="entry">
					<p>TortoiseSVN 1.6.16 has been released.</p>
					<p>This is a bugfix release/maintenance release,
					linked with Subversion 1.6.17.</p>
					<p>Subversion 1.6.17 also contains a few security related
					fixes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2011-1752-advisory.txt">CVE-2011-1752</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2011-1783-advisory.txt">CVE-2011-1783</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2011-1921-advisory.txt">CVE-2011-1921</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Note: these vulnerabilities only refer to Subversion
					servers, not clients. Which means TortoiseSVN is not affected
					by those.</p>
					<p>We still recommend that you update your TortoiseSVN client to
					this latest version. You can get it from our
					<a href="downloads.html">download</a> page.</p>
					<p>Also note that if you upgrade from a version before
					1.6.10, you have to run a repair install after the upgrade.
					To do that, run the installer again and click the "Repair"
					button. I'm sorry about the inconvenience.</p>
					<p>If you want to know why the repair install is required,
					you can read about the technical details in my
					<a href="majorupgrade.html">earlier post</a>.</p>

				<p class="meta">Posted on July 14, 2011</p>
				<div class="entry">
					<p>
					in a few weeks, Subversion 1.7 will be officially released.
					This means that TortoiseSVN 1.7 will be released only a few days later.
					Now it's high time to polish up our translations and finish as many of them as possible.
					In most cases the biggest item on the to-do list is the TortoiseSVN manual.
					</p>
					<p>
					There are five translations where the GUI translation is almost finished and the manual
					is more than 90% done.
					These are:
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/nl/">Dutch</a>,
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/fr/">French</a>,
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/ja/">Japanese</a>,
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/ru/">Russian</a> and
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/es/">Spanish</a>.
					If at least two volunteers help, we should be able to deliver a 100% complete translation for these languages.
					</p>
					<p>
					Close behind are:
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/zh_CN/">Chinese</a> and
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/sl/">Slovenian</a>.
					Their manuals are > 70% finished, but this is going to be a tough job to get it done.
					</p>
					<p>
					Then we have the
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/id/">Indonesian</a>,
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/pl/">Polish</a>,
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/pt_BR/">Portuguese (Brazil)</a> and
					<a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/sk/">Slovak</a>
					manuals, which are between 40% and 60% done. It would be cool to get close to 100%,
					but a lot of work to achieve this goal. The Polish translator is currently very active
					and would surely appreciate any help.
					</p>
					<p>
					Finally there are several languages where no manual exists, but the GUI translation
					is >70% complete. See the <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/resource/trunk-gui/">GUI translation statistics</a>.
					These are the easiest jobs to finish, because the GUI translation
					doesn't have long paragraphs, but many single words or short sentences to translate.
					</p>
					<p>
					Please come and help. We need *you* :) Some information on how to join the translation
					team is available on our <a href="translation.html">translation page</a>.

					<p>We're happy to announce the first beta of TortoiseSVN 1.7.
					It is linked with the latest beta of Apache Subversion 1.7.</p>
					<p>Please give this beta a thorough test drive and help us
					find and fix all bugs and glitches before the final release.
					Especially if you're using TortoiseSVN in your company, you
					should test this version on at least one workstation to make

				<div class="entry">
					<p>TortoiseSVN 1.6.15 has been released.</p>
					<p>This is a bugfix release/maintenance release,
					linked with Subversion 1.6.16. The release contains a fix
					for a first-chance exception in the file open/save dialogs.
					This only affects applications which are run under a debugger
					which must also be configured to catch first-chance exceptions.
					But since TortoiseSVN is mostly used by developers, this
					is annoying so that's why we made this release only a few
					days after the last release. Sorry about that.</p>
					<p>We recommend that you update your TortoiseSVN client to
					this latest version. You can get it from our
					<a href="downloads.html">download</a> page.</p>
					<p>Also note that if you upgrade from a version before
					1.6.10, you have to run a repair install after the upgrade.
					To do that, run the installer again and click the "Repair"
					button. I'm sorry about the inconvenience.</p>
					<p>If you want to know why the repair install is required,
					you can read about the technical details in my
					<a href="majorupgrade.html">earlier post</a>.</p>
