                    <p>A lot of people asked on our mailing lists how they can
                    "unversion a working copy", "detach/unlink a working copy
                    from the repository", "remove files from version control"
                    or something like that. All those questions lead to the
                    users wanting to remove the hidden .svn folders inside
                    every Subversion working copy.</p>

                    <p>Usually, you want a "clean copy" of your versioned files
                    for zipping, archiving, ...<br/>The command in Subversion
                    to do that is "Export". Exporting a working copy or a
                    repository url will create a copy of all your files, but
                    without those .svn folders. But the export command creates
                    a copy, it does not remove the .svn folders from an existing
                    working copy. Which is what most users want.</p>

                    <p>But some users really want to just make a working copy
                    unversioned. Searching the web you can find a lot of users
                    posting scripts which scan a path recursively and delete
                    all those .svn folders. But if you have TortoiseSVN
                    installed, that isn't needed:</p>

                    <p>TortoiseSVN has a little known feature built in which
                    can do exactly that: it removes all .svn folders
                    automatically. So where can you find that feature?<br/>
                    Use the "Export" command! But hey, didn't I just tell you
                    that the export command creates a copy of the files in your
                    working copy and doesn't change your original working copy?
                    So how can the export command remove the .svn folders from
                    an existing working copy?<br/>Simple: when you right-click
                    on a working copy and choose "Export..." from the context
                    menu, a folder browse dialog is shown where you can choose
                    the folder where you want the working copy exported to. If
                    you now select the very same path that your working copy is
                    on as the target (i.e., you're exporting the working copy
                    onto itself), TortoiseSVN will remove all .svn folders of
                    that working copy.</p>

                    <p>Another way to do this is by right-dragging the working
                    copy onto itself. The Explorer doesn't allow dragging items
                    onto themselves in the same window though, so you must
                    either use a second Explorer window or drag onto the tree
                    view as shown in the animation below:<br/>
