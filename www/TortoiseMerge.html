					<h2>TortoiseMerge</h2>
					<p>
						Version control is all about having the history of your working progress.
						But to really see and check the history, you must be able to see and check
						what has changed between two points in time, for example what has changed
						between two releases of your product, or what was changed to fix a bug, or ...
					</p>
					<p>
						This is where TortoiseMerge helps. It is a diff / merge software tool
						for windows with a tight integration for TortoiseSVN.
					</p>

					<h3>Diffing files</h3>
					<p>
						At least for files which consist of text, TortoiseMerge can help you here.
						It shows you the two versions of a file side-by-side, coloring every
						modified line in that file.
					</p>
					<a href="images/TMerge_TwoPane.png" border="none" rel="lightbox[merge]"><img src="images/TMerge_TwoPane-small.png"></a>
					<p>
						You can see in that screenshot that TortoiseMerge also colors the changes
						<em>inside</em> modified lines so you can see immediately what exactly
						has changed.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you reformat your code or text, sometimes you don't really change
						anything but only split a long line into multiple ones, or you merge
						multiple lines into one. TortoiseMerge marks such changes with a white
						circle on the left gray bar of each view. If you see such a white
						circle, you know that no real changes were made, only changes in
						<em>whitespaces</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the bottom of the window, there is a view showing the two lines your
						mouse pointer is currently hovering over. It always shows whitespace characters
						with special chars, and of course it's very handy if you have long lines
						because that view has the double width than the normal views.
					</p>

					<h3>Resolving conflicts</h3>
					<p>
						But that's not all TortoiseMerge is able to do for you. It can also help
						you resolve a conflict by showing you <em>your</em> file, the file which
						has been modified by <em>someone else</em> and the file as it was before
						any of you have modified it, in its <em>original</em> state. Then you can
						easily see where the changes made conflict, and you can choose how to
						resolve that conflict.
					</p>

					<h3>Applying patch files</h3>
					<p>
						When you're working on a project and other people have access to your
						source code, but not necessarily have the rights to commit changes to
						the repository, you sometimes get a patch file with a bug fix or an
						enhancement. TortoiseMerge helps here too, because it can apply those
						patchfiles for you.
					</p>

					<br/>
					<a href="images/ApplyPatch.png" border="none" rel="lightbox[merge]"><img src="images/ApplyPatch-small.png"></a>
					<p>
						On the left is a small window containing all files which the patchfile
						wants to modify. A doubleclick on those file entries opens the file
						to be patched on the left, and the file how it looks like after the
						patch is applied on the right side.
					</p>
					<p>
						To approve the patch, saving the file is enough.
