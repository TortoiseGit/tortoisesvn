			<h3>What is SASL?</h3>
			<p>
				The Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer is
				open source software written by Carnegie Mellon University.
				It adds generic authentication and encryption capabilities
				to any network protocol, and as of Subversion 1.5 and later,
				both the svnserve server and TortoiseSVN client know how to
				make use of this library.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a more complete discussion of the options available, you should
				look at the Subversion book in the section
				<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.serverconfig.svnserve.html#svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl">Using svnserve with SASL</a>.
				If you are just looking for a simple way to set up secure
				authentication and encryption on a Windows server, so that your
				repository can be accessed safely over the big bad Internet,
				read on.
			</p>
			<h3>SASL Authentication</h3>
			<p>
				To activate specific SASL mechanisms on the server, you'll
				need to do three things. First, create a <code>[sasl]</code>
				section in your repository's <cite>svnserve.conf</cite>
				file, with this key-value pair:
			</p>
<pre>
use-sasl = true
</pre>
			<p>
				Second, create a file called <cite>svn.conf</cite> in a
				convenient location - typically in the directory where subversion
				is installed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirdly, create two new registry entries to tell SASL where to
				find things. Create a registry key named
			</p>
<pre>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Carnegie Mellon\Project Cyrus\SASL Library]
</pre>
			<p>
				and place two new string values inside it:
				<code>SearchPath</code> set to the directory path containing
				the <cite>sasl*.dll</cite> plug-ins (normally in the
				Subversion install directory), and <code>ConfFile</code> set
				to the directory containing the <cite>svn.conf</cite> file.
				If you used the CollabNet installer, these registry keys will already
				have been created for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Edit the <cite>svn.conf</cite> file to contain the following:
			</p>
<pre>
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
mech_list: DIGEST-MD5
sasldb_path: C:\TortoiseSVN\sasldb
</pre>
			<p>
				The last line shows the location of the authentication database,
				which is a file called <cite>sasldb</cite>.
				This could go anywhere, but a convenient choice is the repository
				parent path. Make sure that the svnserve service has read access
				to this file.
			</p>
			<p>
				If svnserve was already running, you will need to restart it to
				ensure it reads the updated configuration.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that everything is set up, all you need to do is create some
				users and passwords. To do this you need the
				<code>saslpasswd2</code> program. If you used the CollabNet
				installer, that program will be in the install directory.
				Use a command something like this:
			</p>
<pre>
saslpasswd2 -c -f C:\TortoiseSVN\sasldb -u realm username
</pre>
			<p>
				The <code>-f</code> switch gives the database location,
				<code>realm</code> must be the same as the value you
				defined in your repository's <cite>svnserve.conf</cite>
				file, and username is exactly what you expect it to be.
				Note that the realm is not allowed to contain space characters.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can list the usernames stored in the database using the
				<code>sasldblistusers2</code> program.
			</p>
			<h3>SASL Encryption</h3>
			<p>
				To enable or disable different levels of encryption, you can
				set two values in your repository's
				<cite>svnserve.conf</cite> file:
			</p>
<pre>
[sasl]
use-sasl = true
min-encryption = 128
max-encryption = 256
</pre>
			<p>
				The <code>min-encryption</code> and
				<code>max-encryption</code> variables control the
				level of encryption demanded by the server. To disable
				encryption completely, set both values to 0. To enable
				simple checksumming of data (i.e., prevent tampering and
				guarantee data integrity without encryption), set both
				values to 1. If you wish to allow (but not require) encryption,
				set the minimum value to 0, and the maximum value to some
				bit-length. To require encryption unconditionally, set both
				values to numbers greater than 1. In our previous example,
				we require clients to do at least 128-bit encryption,
				but no more than 256-bit encryption.
