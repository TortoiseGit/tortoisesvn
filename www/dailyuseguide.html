<P class="column">This document describes day to day usage of the TortoiseSVN 
	client. It is <EM>not</EM> an introduction to version control systems, and <EM>not</EM>
	an introduction to SVN. It is more like a place you may turn to when you know 
	approximately what you want to do, but don't quite remember how to do it.
</P>
<P class="column">It is assumed that you already have installed TortoiseSVN.</P>
<P class="column">If you're not familiar with Subversion the you should read "<A href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">Subversion:

<H1 class="column">Terminology</H1>
<P class="column">The terminology used in the SVN documentation, and thus also in 
	TortoiseSVN, may differ from terminology used in other source repository 
	systems. In an attempt to avoid confusion, we provide a short list of the most 
	essential terms. Please make yourself familiar with these words before diving 
	into the rest of this document.

<H1>Creating A Local Repository</H1>
<P>If you don't want to create a local repository and use a server based repository 
	instead then you may skip this chapter.</P>
<P>You can create a local repository with TortoiseSVN very easily:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>
	open the windows explorer
	<LI>
	create a new folder and name it "SVNRepository" for example
	<LI>
		Right-click in the folder. In the context menu select the TortoiseSVN submenu 
		and there "create repository here". Now the repository is created at that 
		location. Don't edit those files yourself! If you get any errors please make 
		sure that the folder is not write protected and empty!</LI>
</OL>
<P>To access your local repository you need the path to that folder. Just remember 
	that Subversion expects all repository paths in the form <EM>"file:///C/SVNRepository/"</EM>
</P>
<H1>Importing A Project To A New Repository</H1>
<P>Before you import your project into a repository you should:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>
	Remove all files which are not needed to build the project (temporary files, 
	files which are generated by a compiler e.g. *.obj, compiled binaries, ...)
	<LI>
	Organize the files in folders and subfolders. Although it is possible to 
	rename/move files later it is highly recommended to do that before importing!
	<LI>
		The recommended directory structure is as follows:<BR>
		/trunk/<BR>
		/branches/<BR>
		/tags/<BR>
		That way you can easily create branches and tags later. Please note that this 
		is only a recommendation. You can of course use any other directory structure 
		you want but it might get difficult to organize branches and tags. If you 
		choose this directory layout then TortoiseSVN will warn you if you try to 
		commit to a path in the /tags/ folder.</LI></OL>
<P>Now select the parent folder of your directory structure in the windows explorer 
	and right click to bring up the context menu. Select the command "Import..." 
	which brings up a dialog box:</P>
<P><IMG alt="Import Dialog" src="images/image7.jpg"></P>
<P>In this dialog you have to enter the URL of the repository you want to import 
	your project into. Don't forget that for also local repositories you have to 
	enter the path in URL form.</P>
<P>The modulename is the name of your project or whatever you want. Usually you use 
	the name of the directory you selected to bring up the context menu (filled in 
	by default).</P>
<P>The import message is used as a log message. Since you usually just started your 
	project a default "initial import" is filled in by TortoiseSVN.</P>
<P>As soon as you press the OK button TortoiseSVN imports the complete directory 
	tree including all files into the repository. Please note that this doesn't put 
	your copy of the project NOT under version control yet. To get a versioned 
	working copy you need to <EM>Checkout</EM> the version you just imported!</P>
<H1>Checking Out A Working Copy</H1>
<P>To obtain a working copy you need to <EM>checkout </EM>it from a repository.</P>
<P>Select a directory in windows explorer where you want to place your working 
	copy. Right-click to bring up the context menu and select the command 
	"Checkout..." which brings up a dialog box:</P>
<P><IMG alt="Checkout Dialog" src="images/image9.jpg"></P>
<P>If you enter a modulename then a directory with that name is created. If the 
	field is left empty then the files are stored directly in the folder you 
	selected in the explorer.</P>
<P>It is recommended that you check out only the "trunk" part of the directory 
	tree. If you specify the parent path of the directory tree in the URL then you 
	might end up with a full harddisk since you will get a copy of each branch and 
	also each tag of your project!</P>
<H1>Icon Overlays</H1>
<P>Now that you have checked out a working copy from a Subversion repository you 
	can see your files in the windows explorer with changed icons. TortoiseSVN adds 
	to each file icon a so called "overlay icon" which overlaps the original file 
	icon. Depending on the Subversion status of the file the overlay icon is 
	different. A fresh checked out working copy has a green checkmark as overlay. 
	that means the Subversion status is "normal". As soon as you start editing a 
	file the status changes to "modified" and the icon overlay then changes to a 
	exclamation mark. That way you can easily see which files were changed since 
	you last updated your working copy and need to be commited. If during an update 
	a "conflict" occurs then the icon changes to a yellow exclamation mark.</P>
<P>The foder icons also have icon overlays displayed. By default, only the status 
	of the folder itself is shown. But you can change that behaviour in the 
	settings (context menu, Settings...) so that the status of folders is shown 
	recursively. This will make the icon overlays for folders slower and is 
	therefore not recommended on slower machines. I'm using that setting on my 
	machine (PIII, 700MHz, 512MB RAM) without problems. With this setting each 
	folder shows the status of all files below it, where status "conflict" 
	overrides "modified" and "modified" overrides "normal". So you can easily see 
	if in a folder theres a file with a conflict or a file which is modified.</P>
<P><IMG alt="Icon Overlays" src="images/image3.jpg"></P>
<P>Unlike TortoiseCVS (the CVS shell integration) no overlay icon for unversioned 
	files is shown.
</P>
<H1>Update Your Working Copy With Changes From Others</H1>
<P>Occasionally you may want changes done by others to get incorporated in your 
	local working copy. The process of getting changes from the server to your 
	local copy is known as <EM>updating</EM>. Updating may be done on single files, 
	a set of selected files, or recursively on entire directory hierarchies. To 
	update, select the files and/or directories you want, right click and select 
	"Update" in the TortoiseSVN submenu. A window will pop up displaying the 
	progress of the update as it runs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<IMG alt="Update Progress" src="images/image10.jpg"></P>
<P><IMG alt="Update Progress finished" src="images/image12.jpg"></P>
<P>Changes done by others will be merged into your files, keeping any changes you 
	may have done to the same files. The repository is <EM>not</EM> affected by an 
	update.
</P>
<P>If you receive reports of conflicts during the update, please read the 
	"resolving conflicts" section.
</P>
<H1>Sending Your Changes To The Repository</H1>
<P>Sending the changes you made to your working copy is known as <EM>committing</EM>
	the changes. But before you commit your changes you really should do an <EM>update</EM>
	first. See the previous chapter on how to do that.</P>
<P>As soon as you updated your working copy and resolved possible conflicts you are 
	ready to commit your changes. Select any file and/or folders you want to commit 
	and select "Commit" in the context menu. A Dialog appears displaying the 
	progress of the commit.</P>
<P><IMG alt="Commit Progress" src="images/image11.jpg"></P>
<H1>Resolving Conflicts</H1>
<P class="column">Once in a while,&nbsp;you will get&nbsp;a <EM>conflict</EM> when 
	you update your files from the repository. A conflict occurs when two or more 
	developers have changed the same few lines of a file. As Subversion knows 
	nothing of your project, it leaves resolving the conflicts to the developers. 
	Whenever a conflict is reported, you should open the file in question, and 
	search for lines starting with the string <TT>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</TT>. 
	The conflicting area is marked like this:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><CODE>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <EM>filename</EM><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<EM>your changes</EM><BR>
			=======<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<EM>code merged from repository</EM><BR>
			&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <EM>revision</EM><BR>
		</CODE>
	</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class="column">Also, for every conflicted file Subversion places three 
	additional files in your directory:</P>
<DIV class="variablelist">
	<DL>
		<DT>
			<SPAN class="term">
				<TT>filename.*.mine</TT></SPAN>
			<DD>
				<P>This is your file as it existed in your working copy before you updated your 
					working copy—that is, without conflict markers. This file has your latest 
					changes in it and nothing else.</P>
				<DT>
					<SPAN class="term">
						<TT>filename.*.rOLDREV</TT></SPAN>
					<DD>
						<P>This is the file that was the BASE revision before you updated your working 
							copy. That is, it the file that you checked out before you made your latest 
							edits.</P>
						<DT>
							<SPAN class="term">
								<TT>filename.*.rNEWREV</TT></SPAN>
							<DD>
								<P>This is the file that your Subversion client just received from the server when 
									you updated your working copy. This file corresponds to the HEAD revision of 
									the repository.</P>
							</DD>
	</DL>
</DIV>
<P>Here <TT>*</TT> represents some random digits that Subversion chooses, <TT>OLDREV</TT>
	is the revision number of the file in your <TT>.svn</TT> directory, and <TT>NEWREV</TT>
	is the revision number of the repository HEAD.
</P>
<P>You should decide what the code should look like, do the necessary changes, 
	execute the command "Resolve" in the context menu, and commit your 
	modifications to the repository. If you don't resolve conflicts Subversion 
	won't allow you to commit your changes.</P>
<H1>Adding New Files And Directories</H1>
<P>If you created new files and/or directories during your development process the 
	you need to add them to source control also. Select the file(s) and/or 
	directory and select the command "Add" from the context menu.</P>
<P>After you added the files/directories to source control the file appears with a 
	"modified" icon overlay which means you first have to commit your working copy 
	to make those files/directories available to other developers. Adding a 
	file/directory does <EM>not</EM> affect the repository!</P>
<P>If you add a directory then TortoiseSVN automatically adds all files in this 
	directory recursively. So be carefull with that command and make sure you don't 
	have any tempory or compiler generated files in that directory!</P>
<P>If you want to add files to your working copy which are currently located 
	outside of that working copy you can select those files and right-drag those 
	files to your working copy. As soon as you release the right mouse button a 
	popup menu appears where you can select "add files to Subversion". The files 
	will then be copied to the working copy and added to version control.</P>
<H1>Deleting, Renaming And Moving Files</H1>
<P>Subversion allows unlike CVS the renaming and moving of files. So there are menu 
	entries for that in the TortoiseSVN submenu.
</P>
<P>For moving files inside&nbsp;a working copy you can either use the command in 
	the TortoiseSVN submenu or use the drag and drop handler:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>
		select the files you want to move</LI>
	<LI>
		right drag them to the new location inside the working copy</LI>
	<LI>
		release the right mouse button</LI>
	<LI>
		in the popup menu select "move files in Subversion to here"</LI></OL>
<H1>Get/Set Information About Files/Directories</H1>
<P>Sometimes you want to have a more detailed information about a file/directory 
	than just the icon overlay. You can get all the information Subversion provides 
	in the explorer properties dialog. Just select the file or directory and select 
	"properties" in the context menu (note: this is the normal properties menu 
	entry the explorer provides, <EM>not</EM> in the TortoiseSVN submenu!). In the 
	properties dialog box TortoiseSVN has added a new property page for files under 
	Subversion control.</P>
<P><IMG alt="Properties" src="images/image15.jpg"></P>
<P>In the Subversion page you can see all relevant information about the selected 
	file/directory. Also, you can read and set the subversion properties.</P>
<P>To show the log entries for the selected item simply press "Show Log..." which 
	brings up the log dialog.</P>
<P><IMG alt="Log Dialog" src="images/image16.jpg"></P>
<P>To view a specific log message select the corresponding entry in the list. If 
	you want to view the changes between your working copy and a specific revision 
	use the context menu in the list. This command receives the specific revision 
	of that file and starts an external diff program to show you the differences. 
	By default TortoiseSVN looks for a copy of WinDiff (which comes with the 
	Windows SDK), but you can set any graphical diff program you want in the 
	TortoiseSVN settings.</P>
<P><IMG alt="Diff Context Menu" src="images/image18.jpg"></P>
<H1>Cancelling Changes</H1>
<P>If you want to cancel all changes you made in a file since the last update you 
	need to select the file, right-click to bring up the context menu and then 
	select the command "Revert" in the TortoiseSVN submenu. But be sure that you 
	really want to do that because all your changes will be lost!</P>
<P>This is also the way if you want to get a deleted file back.</P>
<H1>Tagging</H1>
<P>Subversion does not know a special command for tagging like e.g. CVS. If you 
	need to mark a particular revision (e.g. a release version) you can either do 
	nothing and keep a list of which revision number corresponds to which name or 
	you can use Subversions <EM>cheap copies</EM>. Cheap copies are something 
	similar to links which means that no actual copy is made but just a link to a 
	specific file/revision.</P>
<P>If you have imported your project with the recommended directory structure you 
	would do a tag like this:</P>
<P>Select the parent folder of your working copy and select the command 
	"Branch/Tag..." in the context menu. In the dialog then enter the URL to the 
	directory part for the tags, i.e. instead of /trunk/ now use /tags/tagname 
	where tagname would be e.g. "release_v1.1".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/image19.jpg"></P>
<H1>Branching</H1>
<P>One of the features of version control systems, is the ability to isolate 
	changes onto a separate line of development. This line is known as a <EM>branch</EM>. 
	Branches are usually used to try out new features without disturbing the main 
	branch of development with compiler errors and bugs. As soon as the new feature 
	of the branch is stable enough then the branch is <EM>merged</EM> back into the 
	main branch.</P>
<P>To create a branch with TortoiseSVN select the parent folder and select 
	"Branch/Tag..." in the TortoiseSVN submenu. Since both branches and tags are 
	handled identically in Subversion (they're simply cheap copies) the dialog is 
	the same as for tagging.</P>
<P><IMG alt="Branch Dialog" src="images/image19.jpg"></P>
<P>This time, instead of making a copy in the tags folder make one inside the 
	/branches/ folder. The only difference to tags is that you must not change tags 
	afterwards.</P>
<P>Now you have a separate copy of the development source tree in the repository 
	(but it doesn't use the same amount of disk space - it's a 'cheap copy') on 
	which you can work independently from the main branch. But the new branch is 
	only in the repository for now. To work on the branch you have first to switch 
	your working copy to the newly created branch. Again select the parent folder 
	of your project and select the command "Switch..." from the context menu.</P>
<P><IMG alt="Switch Dialog" src="images/image20.jpg"></P>
<P>here you enter the URL of the branch you just created. Leave the checkbox 
	"newest revision" active. Press ok and your working copy represents now the new 
	branch. If you now make changes in your working copy and commit them then all 
	changes go to the new branch and not the main branch.</P>
<H1>Merging A Branch Back Into The Main Branch</H1>
<P>When you are satisfied with the changes you have done on a branch, you may want 
	those changes to be available on the main line of development. Incorporating 
	changes from one branch to another, is known as <EM>merging</EM>. To do the 
	merge you need to select the parent folder of your project and then select the 
	command "Merge..." in the TortoiseSVN submenu.</P>
<P><IMG alt="Merge Dialog" src="images/image22.jpg"></P>
<P>Enter the URL of the main branch and press OK. While merging, there may occur 
	one or more conflicts. See the chapter "Resolving Conflicts" on how to do this. 
	Once you have resolved all conflicts you can commit the merged files to the 
	main branch.</P>
