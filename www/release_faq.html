		<h2>TortoiseSVN Release FAQ</h2>
	</center>
	<h2>How often is TortoiseSVN released</h2>
	
	<p>Normally there is a new release of TortoiseSVN every time there is
	a new release of Subversion. This means that we are always using the
	latest bug-fixed Subversion libraries. Occasionally, if a major bug
	is found in TortoiseSVN, there may be an additional release to
	fix that.</p>
	
	<h2>Why are the version numbers of Subversion and TortoiseSVN different?</h2>
	
	<p>Because TortoiseSVN is usually released soon after Subversion,
	the version numbers are often the same. But they are independent projects
	and version numbers are not always aligned.</p>
	
	<h2>Does TortoiseSVN follow the same release procedure as Subversion?</h2>
	
	<p>Almost. We also create a stablisization branch before a release, but
	we don't have as many people as the Subversion project, so we don't vote
	which changes go into a stable branch and which ones don't. Each developer
	must decide for himself if a change can go into a stable branch or not.
	</p>
	
	<p>Subversion provides the access to and management of the version control
	database. It is absolutely critical that the Subversion libraries are
	well tested and reliable, so they adopt a very careful and controlled
	release strategy in order to maximise data safety.</p>
	
	<p>TortoiseSVN is a client which uses the Subversion libraries to do
	all the work. If there is a bug in TortoiseSVN it may be inconvenient,
	but it should not compromise data safety, so we do not require the
	same stringent release procedure. This also allows for much a more
	dynamic development process, and less administrative overhead.</p>
	
	<h2>What are Major and Minor releases?</h2>
	
	<p>We define a major release as one which adds significant new
	features. Normally this happens when Subversion adds a new
	feature, and TSVN grows some new UI to support it.</p>
	
	<p>A minor release includes only bugfixes. There may still be a lot of
	small changes.</p>
	
	<h2>How are releases stabilised?</h2>
	
	<p>We have a nightly build site which allows many people to test the
	current trunk build. When we think we're ready for a new major release,
	we create a stable branch from trunk and announce this on the mailing
	list. From this point on, only bugfixes are allowed to go into that
	branch. The nightly builds from that branch are used by many people
	and gets tested that way.</p>
	
	<p>After about a week after the creation of the stable branch, we
	release at least one release candidate (RC) to allow for more
	extensive testing. Release candidates are announced in the same way
	as full releases and allow even more people to get on with testing.
