                    <h3>Preparations</h3>
                    <p>
                    Before you report a bug, please make sure you have completed the following steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Update to the current version. Reports for older 
                        versions <b>will be ignored.</b></li>
                        <li>Check the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/source/browse/trunk/src/Changelog.txt">Changelog</a> 
                        file from /trunk/ and see if your bug has already been 
                        fixed.</li>
                        <li>If possible, update to the latest nightly build 
                        and see if the bug is still there. You can find the 
                        link to the nightly builds on our 
                        <a href="/downloads">downloads.html</a> page.</li>
                        <li>Check the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForums.do">mailing list archive</a>. 
                        Maybe someone else already reported the same bug you're 
                        seeing, and if so that bug might be already fixed.</li>
                        <li>Check the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/wiki/IssueTracker?tm=3">issue tracker</a>. 
                        Maybe your bug has already been filed there.</li>
                        <li>If you've got a zip file from our crashreporting 
                        tool, send it to <nobr><em>crashreports at tortoisesvn.tigris.org</em></nobr>. 
                        Note that we don't answer mails there. Other kinds 
                        of bugreports on that list will be deleted without 
                        being read.
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>How to write the bug report</h3>

                    <p>There is a large number of TortoiseSVN users. There is 
                    a much small number of people who actually develop 
                    TortoiseSVN. There is an even smaller number of people 
                    who actively fix bugs reported by users.</p>
                    <p>What does this mean for you, an aspiring bug reporter? 
                    In order to catch the eye of one of these few 
                    <b>volunteers</b>, you'll need to take to heart a few 
                    tips on how to report a bug so that they can and will 
                    help you.</p>
                    <p>Take special note of that word in bold above. The people 
                    who are going to help you with a bug you report are 
                    <b>volunteers</b>. Not only are you not paying them to 
                    help you, but nobody else is either. So, be nice to them.</p>
                    <p>Beyond that golden rule, what follows are some 
                    additional tips on ways to make your bug report better 
                    so that someone will be able to help you.</p>

                    <h4>The basics: what you did, what you wanted to happen, 
                    and what actually happened.</h4>
                    <p>Those are the three basic elements of a bug report. 
                    You need to tell us exactly what you did (for example, 
                    "I right-clicked on "make happy meal"), what you expected 
                    to have happened (to continue the example, 
                    "I expected TortoiseSVN to serve me a happy meal with a 
                    hamburger and onion rings"), and what actually happened 
                    ("It gave me a happy meal with french fries.").</p>
                    <p>Yes, the example is silly. But if your bug report 
                    simply said "The make_happy_meal function doesn't work," 
                    you will very likely get a reply saying "It works fine for 
                    me", because we can't guess what you were expecting to 
                    happen. By giving all the information you might get a reply 
                    like "That's because you can't have onion rings in a happy 
                    meal, you can only have french fries or curly fries." By 
                    telling us what you asked for, what you expected to get, 
                    and what you actually got, we don't have to guess what 
                    you mean.</p>

                    <h4>Only report one problem in each bug report</h4>
                    If you have encountered two bugs that don't appear to be 
                    related, create a new bug report for each one. This makes 
                    it easier for different people to help with the different 
                    bugs.

                    <h4>Where to send the report to?</h4>
                    <p>Bug reports must be mailed to our mailing list 
                    <nobr><em>users at tortoisesvn tigris org</em></nobr>.

                    for details on how to post.</p>
