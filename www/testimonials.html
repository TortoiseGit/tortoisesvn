					<p>What people have to say about TortoiseSVN:</p>

					<p>TortoiseSVN <a href="http://sourceforge.net/community/index.php/landing-pages/cca07/">won
					the SourceForge.net community choice award 2007</a> in the
					category "<b>Best Tool or Utility for Developers:</b>
					The project most likely to help you make the best of your
					precious coding time".</p>

					<p>Simon Slade, CEO, <a href="http://www.salehoo.com/">SaleHoo.com</a>:</p>
					<blockquote><div>
					Our developers at SaleHoo, a leading wholesale directory
					use TortoiseSVN every day and it’s made a massive difference
					to their productivity and efficiency. We use it across all
					our development work as it lets us to keep track of changes
					to files while multiple developers (including our remote
					ones) are working on them at once. My lead developer often
					remarks that being able to easily see exactly what other
					developers have been working on is both time and
					sanity-saving!  Thanks heaps for the great software guys.
					</div></blockquote>

					<p>Nick Fauchelle - Lead Developer from
					<a href="http://www.affilorama.com/">Affilorama Affiliate Marketing Portal</a>:</p>
					<blockquote><div>We use TortoiseSVN daily in our office and
					recommend it to everyone who is asking about a windows svn
					client. It was first use by our Delphi developer who keep
					a repo on his iPod which allowed him to work from home
					while keeping all the files in sync. We now use it on all
					our development work including of 20 website projects which
					allows us to keep track of changes to our PHP, CSS and JS
					files along with having multiple developers working on the
					site at once without having to worry about lost work.<br/>
					The shell integration is fantastic, quickly able see what
					files have changed at a glance and access svn commands from
					the right click menu make it a breeze.<br/>
					Being able to use svn diff is a very powerful tool in
					a developers belt, and with TSVN gui for seeing the diff
					makes it easy. Seeing changes made in the working copy or
					yesterday, last week etc is a time and sanity saving tool.
					It also allows you to review other developers work,
					changes they've made and then blame them for when they make
					a hash of things.<br/>
					Being open source is a great bonus, a valuable tool at
					price you just can't beat!

					<p>Craig Schroeder from <a href="http://thomson.com">Thomson.com</a>:</p>
					<blockquote><div>I work as a Systems Analyst (i.e.
					requirements procurement/management) for a $1.8 billion
					(US est.) education media conglomerate at the corporate
					level.  Only one systems analysis group at one of our
					business units (~$400 million US) has adopted T/SVN as of
					yet.  I was part of this group at the time and was tasked
					with researching version control and requirements
					management tools for adoption.<br/><br/>
					I chose T/SVN for the following reasons:<br/>
					1.  Directory/Whole Repository versioning.<br/>
					2.  Efficient resource usage (cost, network).<br/>
					3.  Excellent and extensive documentation.<br/>
					4.  Covered requirements for our needs (we had several
					solutions hanging around that were unsatisfactory for one
					reason or another including ClearCase, Documentum, and more).<br/><br/>
					I chose TSVN for the following additional reasons:<br/>
					1.  Ease of use.<br/>
					2.  Mailing list quality (have even participated at times).<br/>
					3.  An extremely low (and sometimes negative!) <a href="abbreviations">ATITSTFAB</a>.<br/>
					4.  Word doc diff script included.<br/><br/>
					There are 10 people with r/w access to a repository
					that contains ~500 .doc &amp; .xls files that make up the
					requirements and configuration documents for one particular
					content delivery platform.  I also use it for my personal
					PHP application development.  We have used every access
					protocol except svn+ssh and https.  Currently we are
					preparing to migrate from svn to http to make use of SSPI
					authentication (a huge plus).<br/>
					I fully expect to extend T/SVN across all business
					units for systems analysis and we expect the Java web
					application development team for the aforementioned
					business unit to migrate from CVS to SVN as soon as they
					get time, allowing us to store requirements and code in
					the same place.<br/>
					As for issues with TSVN, we don't really have any. In
					short, I'm a huge advocate for TSVN and feel like this is
					one of the cleanest, most well run open source projects
					available.

					<blockquote><div>
					I'm one of about 20 developers who work on various projects
					ranging from GUI clients to integration with telephones
					(PBX). Our projects are mainly varius text source files
					(Delphi, HTML, XML, JavaScript, Java, Python etc) and
					number of source files per project is from 20 to >1500.<br/><br/>
					We have used CVS but there were many problems with this.
					Especially if you work on Windows and try to compile on
					Linux, and Delphi IDE sometimes changes case in your
					library filename :( In svn there is less problems because
					of pre-commit hook. It is also easier to use repository.
					Simple CGI program can show links to repositories.  In
					CSV it is much harder.  We use https protocol. I have
					also created Trac environments (see http://trac.edgewall.org/)
					for bigger projects.  So much on svn .<br/>
					I like TSVN because it integrates with Windows shell.
					We use TotalCommander and it co-operates very well with
					TSVN. With CVS we used WinCvs, but it was much harder to
					use.  TortoiseCVS was better, but problems with CVS lead
					us to Subversion+TSVN.<br/><br/>
					Things I like in TSVN:<br/>
					+ integration works very well with TotalCommander<br/>
					+ nice commit dialog where I can sort by extension (not
					possible in WinCVS)<br/>
					+ integrated spellchecker (even for my language: Polish)<br/>
					+ very good and really fast support on TSVNdev list

					I use TortoiseSVN both at work, and generally -- I keep my
					home directory under Subversion and on Windows I use
					TortoiseSVN to keep local copies up to date (since I use
					many different machines, and really really want all my
					goodies present on each -- see
					<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/06/svn_homedir.html">http://www.onlamp.com/pu...svn_homedir.html</a>
					for a whole essay about this).<br/>
					At work, there are perhaps 10 people who use svn at all;
					I'd guess at least half use TortoiseSVN.  As you might
					guess, many of those people are uncomfortable with the
					Windows command line; I wouldn't be surprised if a few
					didn't even know it existed.<br/>
					For accessing my home machine, I use svn+ssh, since I
					don't want to expose my home machine to any other server
					besides SSH (well, I guess I could use svn over http, but
					I'm too lazy to learn how to configure Apache).  As far as
					I know, TortoiseSVN is the only Windows svn client that
					doesn't need anything extra installed to use svn+ssh,
					since it comes with TortoisePlink.  (However, I still use
					pageant, and can't imagine anyone not using it).<br/>
					I've tried every svn GUI client out there.  There really
					is no comparison: TortoiseSVN is brilliantly designed; the
					UI is smooth and _almost_ intuitive; it's _maintained_; you
					can talk to the developers; it's the opposite of
					abandonware ... more incoherent ranting about the<br/>
					failings of every other GUI client can be found at

					<p>Alexander Klenin from <a href="http://www.iexperts.ru">Insight Experts Ltd.</a>:</p>
					<blockquote><div>
					I work at a small Russian software development company, we
					have about two dozen programmers and a few non-programmers
					(managers, marketing etc.) all using TSVN quite
					successfully. Our repository predominantly contains code,
					but have some binary files like Word documents, graphics
					etc. The policy is to discourage such files.<br/>
					Our projects are of moderate size, usually 500 to 2000
					files, 10 to 100 Mb total size per project. All projects
					are located in a common repository, with many files svn-copied
					between projects. Whole setup works very well in both
					performance and reliability.<br/>
					We were using ClearCase before... need I say more?
					TortoiseSVN is far better in every aspect.<br/>
					Almost everything which I do not like is not TSVN's,
					but Subversion's fault. I think SVN+TSVN is the ultimate
					in evolution of centralized version control systems, and
					the only reason to abandon them is moving to a distributed
					development.

					<p>Ivan Cenov:</p>
					<blockquote><div>
					My job is to construct and code firmware for the electronic
					devices that our company produces. These projects are not
					so big, but are many. Many years I used well known winzip
					to maintain version control and was successful in this ....
					but while the project count was small.<br/>
					Then this became impossible and I began to search for
					version control system. I did know about CVS and also have
					read that SVN is its successor. So I chose SVN. Well, I
					did read documentation and the SVN book, I liked it, but
					what I hate is the long command lines. So, I took the
					final decision for SVN after I did found GUI client. I
					find TSVN very intuitive with very quick access to all
					commands. Without GUI client it will take more time to
					enter in the SVN itself.<br/>
					Other thing that I use is bugtracking system Flyspray.
					I managed to integrate TSVN with Flyspray. Now I have
					better, better control over the software process. It
					sometimes happens to update several projects in day and I
					do not lose the control. And at last I use blog system
					Serendipity to write the chronology of my projects.
