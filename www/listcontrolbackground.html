                    <p>While the main focus of
                    <a href="/">TortoiseSVN</a> lies on
                    usability, sometimes I like to add something which doesn't
                    really add a value but just looks nice.</p>

                    <p>Last week I wanted to implement just that: something
                    that looks nice but doesn't disturb the user. The Windows
                    explorer shows a slightly visible image on the bottom right
                    depending on what files are in the folder it currently
                    shows. The image is barely visible like a watermark. I
                    wanted to show such a watermark image in our main dialogs
                    file list.</p>

                    <img class="centered" src="img/explorer-watermark.png" alt="the watermark in Windows explorer"/>

                    <p>The obvious step to get this done would be the
                    <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/z16576bw(vs.80).aspx">SetBkImage</a>
                    method of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/hfshke78(VS.80).aspx">CListCtrl</a>
                    class, since that's the control we use to show the file
                    list in our dialogs. So I called that method like this:</p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp">
HBITMAP hbm = LoadImage(hResource,
                        MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDB_BACKGROUND),
                        IMAGE_BITMAP,
                        128, 128,
                        LR_DEFAULTCOLOR);

m_ListCtrl.SetBkImage(hbm, FALSE, 100, 100);</pre>
                    <p>

                    But of course, that didn't work at all. No background image
                    was shown. Stepping through the code of <code>SetBkImage</code>
                    shows that it's simply a wrapper around the
                    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/listview/messages/lvm_setbkimage.asp">LVM_SETBKIMAGE</a>
                    message. Reading the MSDN docs about that message reviled
                    something that was missing completely from the
                    documentation of <code>SetBkImage</code>: the parameter <code>hbm</code> of the
                    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/listview/structures/lvbkimage.asp">LVBKIMAGE</a>
                    structure is "not currently used". Just great. I then tried
                    to use another option:</p>

                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp">
TCHAR szBuffer[MAX_PATH];
VERIFY(::GetModuleFileName(hResource, szBuffer, MAX_PATH));

CString sPath;
sPath.Format(_T("res://%s/#%d/#%d"),
             szBuffer, RT_BITMAP,
             IDB_BACKGROUND);

m_ListCtrl.SetBkImage(sPath, FALSE, 100, 100);</pre>
                    <p>

                    And that actually worked. But for one, the image was drawn
                    solid with all the transparent pixels of the image drawn
                    black, and the image did not stay at the right bottom when
                    the content of the control was scrolled. I neither could
                    get the image drawn correctly with the alpha channel nor
                    make the image stay at the right bottom, even with setting
                    the image position in the scroll event handler. Obviously,
                    I was on the wrong path here.</p>

                    <img class="centered" src="img/first-try.png" alt="SetBkImage the obvious way"/>

                    <p>Next I tried to draw the image directly in the
                    <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms670610.aspx">NM_CUSTOMDRAW</a>
                    handler of the list control. That worked really well,
                    until I scrolled the list of files a little bit faster.
                    That produced some ugly "leftovers" from the watermark
                    image. Turns out the list control doesn't always redraw
                    its background completely when scrolled, which is actually
                    a good thing for performance, but of course bad for me and
                    what I want to do.<br/>
                    On a sidenote: the
                    <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms672574.aspx">CDRF_NOTIFYPOSTERASE</a>
                    isn't used in the list control.</p>

                    <img class="centered" src="img/ownerdraw.png" alt="The watermark drawn in the NM_CUSTOMDRAW handler"/>

                    <p>But there must be a way, because Microsoft does it with
                    the explorer, assuming of course they don't use some
                    undocumented feature they like to keep to themselves.<br/>
                    Sometimes it is usefull to read the header files from the
                    SDK. In the file <em>commctrl.h</em> I found the following
                    defines for use in the
                    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/listview/structures/lvbkimage.asp">LVBKIMAGE</a>:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp">
#if (_WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0501)
#define LVBKIF_FLAG_TILEOFFSET  0x00000100
#define LVBKIF_TYPE_WATERMARK   0x10000000
#define LVBKIF_FLAG_ALPHABLEND  0x20000000
#endif</pre>
                    <p>
                    But of these three defines, only the first one is
                    documented. Well, not exactly. Searching
                    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">MSDN</a> for
                    <code>LVBKIF_TYPE_WATERMARK</code> revealed
                    <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms670562.aspx">this page</a>.
                    And here those defines are documented. Heureka! Or so I
                    thought.</p>

                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp">
TCHAR szBuffer[MAX_PATH];
VERIFY(::GetModuleFileName(hResource, szBuffer, MAX_PATH));

CString sPath;
sPath.Format(_T("res://%s/#%d/#%d"),
             szBuffer, RT_BITMAP,
             IDB_BACKGROUND);

LVBKIMAGE lv = {0};
lv.ulFlags = LVBKIF_TYPE_WATERMARK|LVBKIF_FLAG_ALPHABLEND;

lv.pszImage = sPath;
lv.xOffsetPercent = 100;

lv.yOffsetPercent = 100;
m_ListCtrl.SetBkImage(&amp;lv);</pre>
                    <p>Nope, didn't work either. Maybe the bitmap I used didn't
                    have a real alpha channel? Removing the
                    <code>LVBKIF_FLAG_ALPHABLEND</code> flag didn't help either.
                    Out of pure desperation I tried this:</p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp">
HBITMAP hbm = LoadImage(hResource,
                        MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDB_BACKGROUND),
                        IMAGE_BITMAP,
                        128, 128,
                        LR_DEFAULTCOLOR);

LVBKIMAGE lv = {0};
lv.ulFlags = LVBKIF_TYPE_WATERMARK;

lv.hbm = hbm;
lv.xOffsetPercent = 100;

lv.yOffsetPercent = 100;
SetBkImage(&amp;lv);</pre>
                    <p>
                    And this worked! Unbelievable. Even though the
                    documentation tells that the <code>hbm</code> member
                    of the <code>LVBKIMAGE</code> structure is "not currently used",
                    it obviously is used (and must be used) if the
                    <code>LVBKIF_TYPE_WATERMARK</code> flag is set.
                    The image was shown in the bottom right corner and stayed
                    there without any UI glitches even when scrolling the file
                    list. But (there's always a "but") the image was not shown
                    with its alpha channel. Where it should have been
                    transparent it was drawn black. But that's what the
                    <code>LVBKIF_FLAG_ALPHABLEND</code> flag is for:</p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp">
HBITMAP hbm = LoadImage(hResource,
                        MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDB_BACKGROUND),
                        IMAGE_BITMAP,
                        128, 128,
                        LR_DEFAULTCOLOR);

LVBKIMAGE lv = {0};
lv.ulFlags = LVBKIF_TYPE_WATERMARK|LVBKIF_FLAG_ALPHABLEND;

lv.hbm = hbm;
lv.xOffsetPercent = 100;

lv.yOffsetPercent = 100;
SetBkImage(&amp;lv);</pre>
                    <p>
                    Or at least that's what I thought. Adding the
                    <code>LVBKIF_FLAG_ALPHABLEND</code> flag made the bitmap disappear.
                    I tried different bitmaps, used different image editors
                    to create a bitmap with alpha channel, but nothing worked.
                    I even extracted the bitmaps from shell.dll which the
                    explorer uses for this. Even those did not work!</p>

                    <p>But giving up so close to reaching the goal? Not me :)<br/>
                    The easy solution would be to simply use a bitmap with a
                    white background. That looks good on most systems where
                    the user hasn't changed the default system colors. But
                    some users actually change them, and some even use red or
                    other colored backgrounds. On those systems, the background
                    image would look really ugly. So that's not a real
                    solution.</p>

                    <p>What I finally came up with was to draw the image alpha
                    blended into an empty bitmap where the background was set
                    to the system background the user has set.</p>

                    <p>And that's how I got this to work. One problem remained:
                    the watermark image was painted over when an item got
                    selected, and the first column was not transparent and
                    was also painting over the watermark.</p>

                    <img class="centered" src="img/fullrowselect.png" alt="The watermark with the LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT set"/>

                    <p>As it turned out, this was due to the fact that I set
                    the <code>LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT</code> style for the control.
                    Removing that style finally made the watermark image behave
                    the exact same way it does in the explorer.</p>

                    <p>And now (drumroll please): the screenshots of the add
                    and commit dialog:</p>
