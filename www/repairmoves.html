					<p>Moving and renaming versioned files inside a working copy
					must always be done with the corresponding
					Subversion/TortoiseSVN commands. A move/rename without
					those (e.g., with the Windows Explorer) leads to problems
					since Subversion doesn't know that you have moved/renamed
					the files.</p>
					<p>For example, if you rename a file named <em>myfile.txt</em>
					to <em>myfile2.txt</em> without using the Subversion/TortoiseSVN
					command, <em>myfile.txt</em> will show up as "missing" and
					<em>myfile2.txt</em> as "non-versioned" in the commit
					dialog or the Check-For-Modifications dialog.</p>

					<p>If that happens to you, TortoiseSVN offers you an easy
					way to correct this. The following screenshot shows how
					the file <em>TSVN-Support.ods</em> was renamed to
					<em>TortoiseSVN-Support.ods</em> without the proper
					commands. They show up in the commit dialog as "missing"
					and "non-versioned". In the commit (or the
					Check-For-Modifications) dialog, you can select both
					files (Ctrl-click), right-click and choose "Repair move"
					from the context menu:</p>

					<p><img src="images/repairmove.png" alt="Repair Move" /></p>

					<p>The "Repair move" command only works if exactly two files
					are selected, one having the "missing" and the other the
					"non-versioned" status. Only that way TortoiseSVN can find
					out which file got renamed to which file. By executing the
					command, TortoiseSVN repeats the rename but using the proper
					Subversion move/rename command:</p>
