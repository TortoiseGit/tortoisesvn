<!-- The class h2 is included on the main div, because the HTML which the
     server will wrap around the page includes a <div class="h2">.
     Thus, we include one here so that the page looks right when previewed
     locally, *but* we override the border which the CSS assigns to that
     style, so that we do not get two borders on the live page. -->

	<h3>Revision graph</h3>
	<p>
	To see the complete history of a file or folder, you can either
	use the log dialog or you can have TortoiseSVN generate a graph
	for you. This graph shows all important (or all, if you really want)
	commits of the selected file/folder.
	</p>
	<img alt="The revision graph" src="images/RevisionGraph.png">
	<p>
	You can export that graph into many different image formats like jpeg/png/bmp/...
	or even the vector format wmf.
	</p>
	<p>
	You can also select two entries and compare them. If the item is a folder, you
	can then see all the files which have changed in between the selected revisions.
	If the selected item is a file, you will see both versions of that file side-by-side.
	</p>
	
	<a name="statistics">
	<h3>Statistics</h3>
	<p>
	When you check the log messages of a file or a folder, TortoiseSVN can
	use the information of those commits to create some statistics and graphs
	for you:
	</p>
	<img alt="Statistics by author" src="images/StatsByAuthor.png">
	<img alt="Statistics by author" src="images/StatsByAuthPie.png">
	<img alt="Statistics by week" src="images/StatsByWeek.png">
	
	<a name="dirdiff">
	<h3>Comparing tags/branches</h3>
	<p>
	Sometimes you want to see what has changed in between two releases, or what the
	difference is between your branch and the main developing line.
	</p>
	<p>
	There are several places where you can check those differences. One is mentioned
	above in the revision graph. Another is from the repository browser:
	</p>
	<img alt="repository browser" src="images/RepoBrowserCompare.png">
	<p>
	Simply select the two tags or branches you want to compare, and then choose "Compare revisions"
	from the context menu. This will bring up the directory diff dialog:
	</p>
	<img alt="directory differences" src="images/DirectoryDiff.png">
	<p>
	This dialog lists all the files and folders that have changed. Doubleclicking on a file
	will start TortoiseMerge (or whatever diff application you have configured TortoiseSVN 
	to use instead) so you can see <b>exactly</b> what has changed.
	</p>
