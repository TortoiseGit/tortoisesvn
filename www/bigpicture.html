					<h3>Revision graph</h3>
					<p>
					To see the complete history of a file or folder, you can either
					use the log dialog or you can have TortoiseSVN generate a graph
					for you. This graph shows all important (or all, if you really want)
					commits of the selected file/folder.
					</p>
					<a href="images/RevisionGraph.png" border="none" rel="lightbox[features]"><img src="images/RevisionGraph-small.png"></a>
					<p>
					You can export that graph into many different image formats like jpeg/png/bmp/...
					or even the vector format wmf.
					</p>
					<p>
					You can also select two entries and compare them. If the item is a folder, you
					can then see all the files which have changed in between the selected revisions.
					If the selected item is a file, you will see both versions of that file side-by-side.
					</p>

					<h3>Statistics</h3>
					<p>
					When you check the log messages of a file or a folder, TortoiseSVN can
					use the information of those commits to create some statistics and graphs
					for you:
					</p>
					<a href="images/StatsByAuthor.png" border="none" rel="lightbox[stats]"><img src="images/StatsByAuthor-small.png"></a>
					<a href="images/StatsByAuthPie.png" border="none" rel="lightbox[stats]"><img src="images/StatsByAuthPie-small.png"></a>
					<a href="images/StatsByWeek.png" border="none" rel="lightbox[stats]"><img src="images/StatsByWeek-small.png"></a>

					<h3>Comparing tags/branches</h3>
					<p>
					Sometimes you want to see what has changed in between two releases, or what the
					difference is between your branch and the main developing line.
					</p>
					<p>
					There are several places where you can check those differences. One is mentioned
					above in the revision graph. Another is from the repository browser:
					First select the first branch/tag you want to compare, right-click and choose "Mark for comparison".
					Then select the second branch/tag you want to compare, right-click and choose "Compare URLs".
					This will bring up the directory diff dialog:
					</p>
					<a href="images/DirectoryDiff.png" border="none" rel="lightbox[none]"><img src="images/DirectoryDiff-small.png"></a>
					<p>
					This dialog lists all the files and folders that have changed. Doubleclicking on a file
					will start TortoiseMerge (or whatever diff application you have configured TortoiseSVN
					to use instead) so you can see <b>exactly</b> what has changed.
