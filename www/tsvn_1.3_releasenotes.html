<h2>What's New in TortoiseSVN 1.3</h2>

<p>TortoiseSVN 1.3 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases.
Anything in 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 1.2.x is also in 1.3, but 1.3 contains
features and bugfixes not present in any earlier release. It is
linked with Subversion 1.3.</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>The "<b>_svn</b>" hack is now officially
       supported: since some versions of ASP.NET don't allow
       directories beginning with dot (e.g., ".svn", the standard
       Subversion working copy administrative directory), TortoiseSVN
       now treats the environment variable SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK
       specially. If this variable is set (to any value), it will
       use "_svn" instead of ".svn". Note that once the environment
       variable is set, working copies with standard ".svn" directories
       will stop working, and will need to be re-checked-out to get "_svn"
       instead.</p>

       <p class="infomark">After you've set the environment variable,
       you must restart the shell for the changes to take effect.</p>

       <p class="todo"><i>TODO: Adjust the FAQ once 1.3 is released.</i></p>
   </li>

   <li><p>During http:// and https:// transfers, TortoiseSVN now
       shows information about the transferred data (transfer speed,
       bytes transferred).</p>
   </li>
   
   <li><p>TortoiseSVN can now authenticate against apache based
       repositories with SSPI automatically. That means you don't have
       to enter username/passwords anymore but TortoiseSVN automatically
       authenticates with your windows login data.</p>
       
       <p class="todo"><i>TODO: Adjust the 
       <a href="http://tortoisesvn.berlios.de/?q=node/89">FAQ</a> once
       1.3 is released.</p>
   </li>
   
   <li>
       The shell context menu has now key accelerators for better
       use with the keyboard.
   </li>
   
   <li>
       Many many more small improvements and bug fixes.
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.3
servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.3 features may not
be available unless both client and server are the latest version.
There is <strong>no need</strong> to upgrade your repositories;
</p>

<p>If you access a BDB repository using <tt>file://</tt> access
you will need to update that repository to BDB 4.3 format. But this is
only necessary if you're upgrading from a TortoiseSVN version before
1.2.
Instructions on how to do that can be found on the
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#bdb43-upgrade">
Subversion FAQ page</a></p>
