					<p>(revision 0.5 by (c) Marc Logemann)</p>
					<p>Because many new subversion users run into problems when
					attempting to use subversion with SSH, I compiled a HowTo
					for that issue. Perhaps I will expand this HowTo later on
					and submit it to the Subversion or TortoiseSVN docs.</p>
					<p>-------------------------<br/>
					Our Scenario:<br/>
					-------------------------<br/>

					Server: Linux or unix like system<br/>
					Client: Windows 2000/XP (or variant)</p>
					<p>-----------------------------------------<br/>
					Installing subversion (server)<br/>
					-----------------------------------------<br/>
					I won't go into details here, because this topic is
					covered in great length in the official Subversion
					documentation. But one thing I want to point out
					nevertheless. If you compile subversion from source and
					don't provide any argument to ./configure, Subversion
					creates a "bin" directory under /usr/local and places its
					binaries there. This is no problem as long as you run
					subversion as daemon, but if you want to use tunnelling
					mode with SSH, you have to be aware that the user logging
					into via SSH can execute the svnserve program and some
					other binaries. For this reason, either place /usr/local/bin
					into the PATH variable or create symlinks of your binaries
					to the /usr/sbin directory or any other directory which is
					commonly in the PATH.</p>
					<p>To make sure that everything is OK. Login in with SSH
					and the target user to the system later on and type:
					"which svnserve". This command should tell you if svnserve
					is reachable.<br/>
					To check if svnserve is available through ssh, type:
					"ssh  svnserve"</p>
					<p>Furthermore this document assumes that you already have
					a subversion repository created with "svnadmin create".
					Please pay attention to the ACL of the repository in order
					to reduce possible problems. Check that each user coming
					in via SSH has appropriate rights to work with the
					repository.</p>

					<p>Sometimes your system has 'mesg y' put into the global
					bashrc file. This will make connections with TortoisePlink
					fail, since that line will make SSH throw out an error
					"stdin: is not a tty". You must remove that line from
					your bashrc file.<br/>
					------------------------------------------------<br/>
					OpenSSH and certificates (server)<br/>
					------------------------------------------------<br/>
					Again I wont go into details about OpenSSH installation as
					this is covered elsewhere better. But on most systems,
					enabling SSH is just a matter of installing an RPM. If you
					rent a pre-installed linux server from a hosting company,
					SSH is most likely already installed. To be sure everything
					is in place, type: "ps xa | grep sshd" and watch out for
					SSH jobs.</p>
					<p>Assuming OpenSSH is installed, one of the most important
					steps is to create a keypair for authentication. There are
					two possible ways of creating the keys. The first way is
					to create the keys with puttygen (a program of the putty
					family), upload the public key to your server and use the
					private key with putty. Because of some problems with this
					approach, I prefer the other way. This way creates the
					keypair with the OpenSSH tool ssh-keygen, downloads the
					private key to your client and converts the private key
					to a putty-style private key.</p>
					<p>Lets do this step by step:</p>
					<p>- login to your server<br/>
					- type: ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t dsa -N passphrase -f mykey<br/>

					- change "passphrase" to a secret keyword only you know<br/>
					- type: ls -l mykey*</p>
					<p>We just created a SSH2 DSA key with 1024 bit keyphrase.
					You will see two files. One named "mykey" and one named
					"mykey.pub". As you might guess, the .pub file is the
					public key file, the other is the private one. Next create
					a user on the server with a home directory:</p>
					<p>- type: useradd -m myuser</p>
					<p>You will have a directory under /home with the name
					"myuser", create a new directory in "myuser" called ".ssh":</p>
					<p>- type: cd /home/myuser<br/>
					- type: mkdir .ssh</p>
					<p>Then go to the directory where you created your keys
					and copy the public key to the .ssh userfolder with the
					following command:</p>
					<p>- type: cp mykey.pub /home/myuser/.ssh/authorized_keys</p>

					<p>or if you already have some keys in place</p>
					<p>- type: cat mykey.pub &gt;&gt; /home/myuser/.ssh/authorized_keys</p>
					<p>Please pay attention to the filename, it really must
					be "authorized_keys". In some old OpenSSH implementations,
					it was "authorized_keys2". Now download the private key
					file to your client computer. Remember, the file was "mykey"</p>
					<p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
					SSH key generation and connection check (client)<br/>
					------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
					Grab the tools we need for doing SSH on windows on this site:<br/>
					http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</p>

					<p>Just go to the download section and get "Putty", "Plink",
					"Pageant" and "Puttygen"</p>
					<p>In order to use the private key we get from the server,
					we have to convert it to a putty format. This is because
					the private key file format is not specified by some
					standard body. To do this we simple open "puttygen" and
					open the "conversions" menu and chose "Import Key". Then
					browse to your file "mykey" which you got from the server
					enter your provided passphrase upon creation of the key.
					Finally click "Save private key" and save the file as
					"mykey.PPK" somewhere on disk.</p>
					<p>Now we are ready to use this key for the first time to
					test the connection. In order to do this, we open the
					program "putty" and create a new session like this:</p>
					<p>Session-&gt;HostName: Hostname or IP Adress of your server<br/>
					Session-&gt;Protocol: SSH<br/>
					Session-&gt;Saved Sessions: MyConnection<br/>
					SSH-&gt;Prefered SSH Protocol version: 2<br/>

					SSH-&gt;Auth-&gt;Private Key file for auth: $PATH$\mykey.PKK
					(replace $PATH$ with real path to the mykey.PKK file)</p>
					<p>Then go back to Session tab and hit "save" button. You
					will see "MyConnection" in the list of available connections.</p>
					<p>Next click "open" and you should see a telnet login
					prompt. Use "myuser" as username (without double quotes
					of course) and if everything is OK, you don't have to
					provide a password to your system. If the system still
					requires a password, something went wrong. See Debugging
					Section of this HowTo.</p>
					<p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>
					Testing SSH with TortoiseSVN (client)<br/>
					-----------------------------------------------<br/>
					After installing TortoiseSVN right click on some folder
					inside your Windows Explorer. You will see a menu item
					called TortoiseSVN-&gt;RepoBrowser. After opening the
					browser you have to enter a URL like this:</p>

					<p>svn+ssh://myuser@MyConnection/usr/local/repos</p>
					<p>Lets talk briefly about the URL (if you need more infos,
					check the subversion docs). The Schema name is "svn+ssh",
					this tells Tortoise how to handle the requests to the
					server. After the double slashed, you can provide the
					user which is trying to connect to the server, in our case
					this is "myuser". After the "@", we supply our putty
					session name. This session name contains all details like
					where to find the private key and the servers IP or DNS.
					Last we have to provide the full path to the repository.
					Its assumed that a subversion repository resides at
					/usr/local/repos</p>
					<p>If you submit the URL, you will see an opened tree on
					the next screen until the node "repos". Yet, there has not
					been made any connection, because the tree representation
					comes from the supplied URL. When you hit the "+" button
					in front of "repos", the connection will be established
					and you will see the "+" sign disappearing if you don't
					have anything in the repository or you will see your
					already imported projects and files.</p>
					<p>Right now, you should have a running SSH Tunnel in
					conjunction with TortoiseSVN.</p>
					<p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>
					Configuration Variants (pageant)<br/>
					-----------------------------------------------<br/>
					Now I will continue to show some configuration variants,
					that can be helpful during everyday work.</p>
					<p>One way to simplify the URL in TortoiseSVN is to set
					the user inside the putty session. For this you have to
					load your already defined session "MyConnection" in putty
					make the following entry:</p>

					<p>connection-&gt;Auto Login username: myuser</p>
					<p>Then save your putty session as before and try the
					following URL inside Tortoise:<br/>
					svn+ssh://MyConnection/usr/local/repos</p>
					<p>This time we only provide the putty session "MyConnection"
					to the SSH client TortoiseSVN uses (TortoisePlink.exe).
					This client is capable of checking the session for all
					necessary details like loginuser or server ip.</p>
					<p>Some people like using pageant for storing all their
					keys and in fact each howto explains that it is important
					to place your keys there. In fact, because a putty session
					is capable of storing a key, you don't need pageant for
					normal business. But imagine you want to store keys for
					several users, in that case, you would have to edit the
					putty session over and over again, depending on the user
					you are trying to connect with. For this situation pageant
					makes perfectly sense, because when putty, plink,
					TortoisePlink or any other putty-based tool is trying to
					connect to a SSH server, it checks all private keys that
					pageant carries to initiate the connection.</p>
					<p>For this task, simply start pageant and add a key. It
					should be the same private key you defined in the putty
					session above. If you use pageant for private keys storage,
					you can delete the "SSH-&gt;Auth-&gt;Private Key file for
					auth" section inside your putty session. You can add more
					keys for other systems or other users of course. If you
					don't want to repeat this procedure after every reboot of
					your client, you should place the pageant in autostart
					group of your windows installation. You can append the
					keys with complete paths as command line arguments to
					pageant.exe</p>
					<p>The last way to connect to a SSH server is by just
					using this URL inside TortoiseSVN:</p>

					<p>svn+ssh://myuser@100.101.102.103/usr/local/repos</p>
					<p>As you can see, we dont use a saved putty session but
					an IP address as connection target. We also supply the
					user, but you might ask how the private key file will be
					found. Because TortoisePlink.exe (the standard SSH client
					for TortoiseSVN) is a modified version of the plink tool
					from the putty suite, also TortoiseSVN looks for a running
					pageant and will try all the keys stored in pageant.</p>
