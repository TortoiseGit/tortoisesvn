<!-- The class h2 is included on the main div, because the HTML which the
     server will wrap around the page includes a <div class="h2">.
     Thus, we include one here so that the page looks right when previewed
     locally, *but* we override the border which the CSS assigns to that
     style, so that we do not get two borders on the live page. -->

	<h2>Mailing List Etiquette</h2>
	
	<p>A little bit of common sense should make it unneccessary to place this 
	etiquette here, but since many people don't seem to know some basic rules... 
	<div class="alert">
	Here they are:
	<ul>
	<li>Answers go only to the mailing-list. If you don't want to subscribe to the
		list, you can read the answers in the archives (see below) or ask that the
		answers get CC'ed to you directly.</li>
	<li>Don't mail the project owners directly. We are going to ditch these mails.</li>
	<li>Answer below the quote.</li>
	<li>Delete unnecessary text (signatures) in the quote.</li>
	<li>No full quoting. Keep just enough of the original text so that others can
	see the questions you are answering.</li>
	<li>If you want to change to a different topic, create a new thread.
	Don't just answer another message and replace the subject.</li>
	<li>Limited text length per line (e.g. max. 72 characters).</li>
	<li>No html or rtf mails</li>
	<li>No big (larger than 10kB) attachments. Screenshots are ok, but send them as
		jpeg's or png's. Some people sent us screenshots in a WORD document - don't
		expect anyone to even open such a document.</li>
	<li>Don't ask for mail receipts.</li>
	<li>Don't send "out-of-office" replies or other autoresponder messages to the list.</li>
	</ul>
	for further reading see: 
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://learn.to/quote">How To Quote</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a></li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	Thanks.

	Before you ask questions on the mailing list, please have a look at our archives:

	<p class="infomark">Please note that our mailing lists are moderated. That means that if you're not subscribed to the
	list, your mail will not show up on the list until our moderators have reviewed your mail. This is done to avoid SPAM
	on the list. So be patient, it may take some time, but your mail will show up on the list.</p>
	<p>
	If your company attaches a so called disclaimer to every mail, please contact your
	IT department and ask them to remove it. If you don't know how to convince them, just ask them to
	replace the disclaimer with this one:
	</p>
	<p>
	<i>
	We don't know how to use the security and encryption features of
	our e-mail server.  We are so confused that we cannot even be
	certain that this e-mail was delivered to the proper person.  So,
	if you received this e-mail because of our incompetence, please
	delete it and notify us as soon as possible.  Notice that this is
	being written in the most scary legalistic way, so no one notices
	how incompetent we are.
