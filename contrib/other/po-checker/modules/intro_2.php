<h1>TSVN poChecker</h1>
	<p>This tool, to be used before committing your work, should help you locate problems in translation files. Please consider it as work-in-progress, as we are still working on it.</p>
	<p>First of all, it will help you find missing accelerators - Luebbe's translation status page shows counts but not strings themselves, so the table below will help you fix these problems.</p>
	<p>The analysis also includes some other useful lists, it checks for instance for correct new line styles, untranslated strings and spelling mistakes. As we prefer to err on the side of caution, you may find a lot of false positives. Anyway I hope this will help you improve the quality of your translation.</p>
