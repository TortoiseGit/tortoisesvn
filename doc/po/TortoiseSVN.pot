msgid "Most of the time you want merge to take account of the file's history, so that changes relative to a common ancestor are merged. Sometimes you may need to merge files which are perhaps related, but not in your repository. For example you may have imported versions 1 and 2 of a third party library into two separate directories. Although they are logically related, Subversion has no knowledge of this because it only sees the tarballs you imported. If you attempt to merge the difference between these two trees you would see a complete removal followed by a complete add. To make Subversion use only path-based differences rather than history-based differences, check the <guilabel>Ignore ancestry</guilabel> box.
