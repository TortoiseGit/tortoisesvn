		Sometimes you need to know where branches and tags were taken from
		the trunk, and the ideal way to view this sort of information is
		as a graph or tree structure. That's when you need to use
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Revision Graph...</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
	</para>
	<para>
		This command analyses the revision history and attempts to create
		a tree showing the points at which copies were taken, and when
		branches/tags were deleted.
		Please note: It can take several minutes to retrieve all the data
		needed to create the revision graph, depending on how much the project
		has changed and of course your network connection to the repository.
	</para>
	<para>
		The revision graph shows several types of node:
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Added file/folder</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Items which have been added, or created by copying
						another file/folder are shown using a rounded rectangle.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Deleted file/folder</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Deleted items eg. a branch which is no longer required,
						are shown using an octagon (rectangle with corners cut off).
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Normal file/folder</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						All other items are shown using a plain rectangle.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
		</variablelist>
		Note that the graph only shows the points at which items were added or
		deleted. Showing every revision of a project would generate an impossibly
		large graph for non-trivial cases.
		For this reason, simple project structures with no adds or deletes will
		produce an empty revision graph with the message
		<literal>No graph available</literal>.
	</para>
	<para>
		The revision date, author and comments are shown in a hint box whenever
		the mouse hovers over a revision box.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you select two revisions (Use <action>Ctrl left click</action>),
		you can use the context menu to show the
		differences between these revisions. You can choose to show differences
		as at the branch creation points, but usually you will want to show the
		differences at the branch end points, i.e. at the HEAD revision.
	</para>
	<para>
		You can view the differences as a Unified-Diff file, which shows all
		differences in a single file with minimal context. If you opt to
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Compare Revisions</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		you will be presented with a list of changed files.
		<action>Double click</action> on a file name to fetch both revisions
		of the file and compare them using the visual difference tool.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you <action>right click</action> on a revision you can use
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Show Log</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		to view the history.
	</para>
	<caution>
		Because Subversion cannot provide all the information required,
		a certain amount of interpretation is required, which can sometimes
		give strange results. Nevertheless, the output for the trunk will
		generally give useful results.
	</caution>
