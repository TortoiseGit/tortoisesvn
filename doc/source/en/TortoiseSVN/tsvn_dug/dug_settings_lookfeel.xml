		This page allows you to specify which of the TortoiseSVN context menu

	<para>
		There is a special case for <guilabel>Get Lock</guilabel>. You can of
		course promote it to the top level using the list above, but as most
		files don't need locking this just adds clutter. However, a file with
		the <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal> property needs this action every
		time it is edited, so in that case it is very useful to have at the top
		level. Checking the box here means that when a file is selected which has
		the <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal> property set,
		<guilabel>Get Lock</guilabel> will always appear at the top level.

			<figure id="tsvn-dug-settings-dia-overlay">
				<title>The Settings Dialog, Look and Feel Page</title>
				<graphic fileref="../images/SettingsOverlay.png"/>
			</figure>
			This page allows you to choose the items for which TortoiseSVN will
			display icon overlays. Network drives can be very slow, so by default
			icons are not shown for working copies located on network shares.
			You can even disable all icon overlays, but where's the fun in that?
		</para>
		<para>
			USB Flash drives appear to be a special case in that the drive type
			is identified by the device itself. Some appear as fixed drives,
			and some as removable drives.
		</para>
		<para>
			By default, overlay icons and context menus will appear in all open/save
			dialogs as well as in Windows Explorer. If you want them to appear
			<emphasis>only</emphasis> in Windows Explorer, check the
			<guilabel>Show overlays and context menu only in explorer</guilabel> box.
		</para>
		<para>
			Since it takes quite a while to fetch the status of a working copy,
			TortoiseSVN uses a cache to store the status so the explorer
			doesn't get hogged too much when showing the overlays.
			You can choose which type of cache TortoiseSVN should use according
			to your system and working copy size here:
			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Default</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Caches all status information in a separate process
							(<filename>TSVNCache.exe</filename>). That process
							watches all drives for changes and fetches the status
							again if files inside a working copy get modified.
							The process runs with the least possible priority so
							other programs don't get hogged because of it. That 
							also means that the status information is not
							<emphasis>real time</emphasis> but it can take a few
							seconds for the overlays to change.
						</para>
						<para>
							Advantage: the overlays show the status recursively,
							i.e. if a file deep inside a working copy is modified,
							all folders up to the working copy root will also
							show the modified overlay. And since the process can
							send notifications to the shell, the overlays on the left
							tree view usually change too.
						</para>
						<para>
							Disadvantage: the process runs constantly, even if you're not 
							working on your projects. It also uses around 10-50 MB of RAM 
							depending on number and size of your working copies.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Shell</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Caching is done directly inside the shell extension
							dll, but only for the currently visible folder.
							Each time you navigate to another folder, the status
							information is fetched again.
						</para>
						<para>
							Advantage: needs only very little memory (around 1 MB of RAM)
							and can show the status in <emphasis>real time</emphasis>.
						</para>
						<para>
							Disadvantage: Since only one folder is cached, the overlays
							don't show the status recursively. For big working copies,
							it can take more time to show a folder in explorer than
							with the default cache. Also the mime-type column is not
							available.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>None</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							With this setting, the TortoiseSVN does not fetch the status
							at all in Explorer. Because of that, files don't get an overlay
							and folders only get a 'normal' overlay if they're versioned.
							No other overlays are shown, and no extra columns are available
							either.
						</para>
						<para>
							Advantage: uses absolutely no additional memory and does
							not slow down the Explorer at all while browsing.
						</para>
						<para>
							Disadvantage: Status information of files and folders is not
							shown in Explorer. To see if your working copies are modified,
							you have to use the "Check for modifications" dialog.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
			</variablelist>
		</para>
		<para>
			If you select the default option, you can also choose to mark folders as
			modified if they contain unversioned items. This could be useful for
			reminding you that you have created new files which are not yet versioned.
		</para>
		<para>
			The <guilabel>Exclude Paths</guilabel> are used to tell TortoiseSVN
			those paths for which it should <emphasis>not</emphasis> show icon
			overlays and status columns.
			This is useful if you have some very big working copies containing
			only libraries which you won't change at all and therefore don't
			need the overlays. For example:
		</para>
		<para>
			<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename> will disable
			the overlays <emphasis>only</emphasis> on that specific folder. You
			still can see the overlays on all files and folder inside that folder.
		</para>
		<para>
			<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion*</filename> will disable the
			overlays on <emphasis>all</emphasis> files and folders whose path
			starts with <filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename>. That
			means you won't see overlays for any files and folders below that
			path.
		</para>
		<para>
			The same applies to the <guilabel>Include Paths</guilabel>. Except that
			for those paths the overlays are shown even if the overlays are disabled
			for that specific drive type, or by an exclude path specified above.
		</para>
		<para>
			TSVNCache.exe also uses these paths to restrict its scanning. If you
			want it to look only in particular folders, disable all drive types
			and include only the folders you specifically want to be scanned.
		</para>
		<para>
			Sometimes you will exclude areas that contain working copies,
			which saves TSVNCache from scanning and monitoring for changes,
			but you still want a visual indication that such folders are versioned.
			The <guilabel>Show excluded folders as 'normal'</guilabel> checkbox
			allows you to do this. With this option, versioned folders in any
			excluded area (drive type not checked, or specifically excluded)
			will show up as normal and up-to-date, with a green check
			mark. This reminds you that you are looking at a working copy, even
			though the folder overlays may not be correct. Files do not get an
			overlay at all. Note that the context menus still work, even though
			the overlays are not shown.
		</para>
		<para>
			As a special exception to this, drives <literal>A:</literal>
			and <literal>B:</literal> are never considered for the
			<guilabel>Show excluded folders as 'normal'</guilabel> option.
			This is because Windows is forced to look on the drive, which can
			result in a delay of several seconds when starting Explorer, even
			if your PC does have a floppy drive.

				<term>Cache log messages</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Fetching log messages can take a long time on some repositories,
						depending on how good the connection is, server load, etc.
						TortoiseSVN has the facility to cache log messages locally to
						avoid the need to fetch them from the server. The cache is filled
						in as part of the normal log message fetch, so there is no need
						to take any other action.
					</para>
					<para>
						You should keep in mind that log messages can be edited, so if
						someone else changes a log message and you have a cached copy,
						you will not see the changes unless you clear the log message
						cache. Use the <guilabel>Saved Data</guilabel> tab to do that.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Progress Dialog</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						TortoiseSVN can automatically close all progress dialogs 
						when the action is finished without error. This setting
						allows you to select the conditions for closing the
						dialogs. The default (recommended) setting is
						<guilabel>Close manually</guilabel>
						which allows you to review all messages and check what
						has happened. However, you may decide that you want to
						ignore some types of message and have the dialog
						close automatically if there are no critical changes.
					</para>
					<para>
						<guilabel>Auto-close if no merges, adds or deletes</guilabel>
						means that the progress dialog will close if there were
						simple updates, but if changes from the repository were
						merged with yours, or if any files were added or deleted,
						the dialog will remain open. It will also stay open if
						there were any conflicts or errors during the operation.
					</para>
					<para>
						<guilabel>Auto-close if no merges, adds or deletes for
						local operations</guilabel> means that the progress dialog
						will close as for <guilabel>Auto-close if no merges, adds
						or deletes</guilabel> but only for local operations like adding
						files or reverting changes. For remote operations the
						dialog will stay open.
					</para>
					<para>
						<guilabel>Auto-close if no conflicts</guilabel>
						relaxes the criteria further and will close the dialog
						even if there were merges, adds or deletes. However,
						if there were any conflicts or errors, the dialog
						remains open.
					</para>
					<para>
						<guilabel>Auto-close if no errors</guilabel>
						always closes the dialog even if there were conflicts.
						The only condition that keeps the dialog open is an
						error condition, which occurs when Subversion is unable
						to complete the task. For example, an update fails
						because the server is inaccessible, or a commit fails
						because the working copy is out-of-date.
					</para>

			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Use URL of WC as the default "From:" URL</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						In the merge dialog, the default behaviour is for the
						<guilabel>From:</guilabel> URL to be remembered between
						merges. However, some people like to perform merges from
						many different points in their hierarchy, and find it easier
						to start out with the URL of the current working copy.
						This can then be edited to refer to a parallel path on
						another branch.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Default checkout path</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						You can specify the default path for checkouts. If you keep all

						to the end.
					</para>

				<term>Default checkout URL</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
