		Sometimes you need to know not only what lines have changed, but also

			<guimenuitem>Blame...</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		command, sometimes also referred to as <firstterm>annotate</firstterm>
		command comes in handy.

	<para>
		This command lists, for every line in a file, the author and the revision
		the line was changed.

            If you're not interested in changes from earlier revisions you can
            set the revision from which the blame should start. Set this to <literal>1</literal>,
            if you want the blame for <emphasis>every</emphasis> revision.
        </para>
        <para>
            By default the blame file is viewed using <firstterm>TortoiseBlame</firstterm>,
            which highlights the different revisions to make it easier to read.
            If you wish to print or edit the blame file, select
            <guilabel>Use Text viewer to view blames</guilabel>

        <para>
            Once you press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> TortoiseSVN starts retrieving
            the data to create the blame file. Please note: This can take several
            minutes to finish, depending on how much the file has changed and
            of course your network connection to the repository. Once the blame
            process has finished the result is written into a temporary file and
            you can view the results.

            TortoiseBlame, which is included with TortoiseSVN, makes the blame file
            easier to read. When you hover the mouse over a line in the blame info
            column, all lines with the same revision are shown with a darker
            background. Lines from other revisions which were changed by the same author
            are shown with a light background.
            The colouring may not work as clearly if you have your display set to
            256 colour mode.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you <action>left click</action>
            on a line, all lines with the same revision are highlighted, and lines from
            other revisions by the same author are highlighted in a lighter colour.
            This highlighting is sticky, allowing you to move the mouse without losing
            the highlights. Click on that revision again to turn off highlighting.
        </para>
        <para>
            The revision comments are shown in a hint box whenever the mouse hovers over
            the blame info column.

        <para>
            You can search within the Blame report using
            <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
                <guimenuitem>Find...</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice>.
            This allows you to search for revision numbers, authors and the content of
            the file itself. Log messages are not included in the search - you should
            use the Log Dialog to search those.

        <para>
            One of the limitations of the Blame report is that it only shows the file as
            it was in a particular revision, and shows the last person to change each line.
            Sometimes you want to know what change was made, as well as who made it. What
            you need here is a combination of the diff and blame reports.
        </para>
        <para>
            The revision log dialog includes several options which allow you to do this.
            <variablelist>

                            In the top pane, select 2 revisions, then select
                            <menuchoice>

                            This will fetch the blame data for the 2 revisions, then
                            use the diff viewer to compare the two blame files.
