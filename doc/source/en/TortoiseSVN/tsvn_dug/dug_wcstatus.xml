		While you are working on your working copy you often need to know
		which files you have changed/added/removed or renamed, or even which
		files got changed and committed by others.

			</figure>
		</para>
		<para>
			Now that you have checked out a working copy from a Subversion
			repository you can see your files in the windows explorer with
			changed icons. This is one of the reasons why TortoiseSVN is so
			popular. TortoiseSVN adds a so called overlay icon to each
			file icon which overlaps the original file icon. Depending on
			the Subversion status of the file the overlay icon is different.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/InSubVersionIcon.png"/>
			A fresh checked out working copy has a green checkmark as overlay.
			That means the Subversion status is <literal>normal</literal>.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/ModifiedIcon.png"/>
			As soon as you start editing a file,
			the status changes to <literal>modified</literal>
			and the icon overlay then changes to a red exclamation
			mark. That way you can easily see which files were changed
			since you last updated your working copy and need to be committed.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/ConflictIcon.png"/>
			If during an update a <literal>conflict</literal> occurs then
			the icon changes to a yellow exclamation mark.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/ReadOnlyIcon.png"/> 
			If you have set the <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal> property on a file,
			Subversion makes that file read-only until you get a lock on that file.
			Read-only files have this overlay to indicate that you have to get a lock
			first before you can edit that file.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/LockedIcon.png"/> 
			If you hold a lock on a file, and the Subversion status is
			<literal>normal</literal>, this icon overlay reminds you that you
			should release the lock if you are not using it to allow others to
			commit their changes to the file.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/DeletedIcon.png"/> 
			This icon shows you that some files or folders inside the current folder
			have been scheduled to be <literal>deleted</literal> from version control
			or a file under version control is missing in a folder.
		</para>
		<para>
			<graphic fileref="../images/AddedIcon.png"/> 
			The plus sign tells you that a file or folder has been scheduled to be
			<literal>added</literal> to version control.
		</para>
		<para>
			Unlike TortoiseCVS (the CVS shell
			integration) no overlay icon for unversioned files is shown.
			We do this because the number of icon overlays are limited system wide
			and should be used economically.
		</para>
		<para>
			In fact, you may find that not all of these icons are used on your system.
			This is because the number of overlays allowed by Windows is limited to 15.
			Windows uses 4 of those, and the remaining 11 can be used by other applications.
			If you are also using TortoiseCVS, then there are not enough overlay slots
			available, so TortoiseSVN tries to be a <quote>Good Citizen (TM)</quote>
			and limits its use of overlays to give other apps a chance.

		<para>
			The same information which is available from the icon overlays
			(and much more) can be displayed as additional columns in

		</para>
		<para>
			Simply right click on one of the headings of a column, choose
			<guimenuitem>More...</guimenuitem> from the context menu displayed. A
			dialog will appear where you can specify the columns and their
			order, which is displayed in the "Detailed View". Scroll down
			until the entries starting with SVN come into view. Check the
			ones you would like to have displayed and close the dialog by
			pressing <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. The columns will be appended
			to the right of those currently displayed. You can reorder them by
			drag and drop, or resize them, so that they fit your needs.

			It's often very useful to know which files you have
			changed and also which files got changed and
			committed by others. That's where the command
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Check For Modifications...</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			comes in handy.
			This dialog will show you every file that has changed in any
			way in your working copy, as well as any unversioned files
			you may have.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you click on the
			<guibutton>Check Repository</guibutton> then you can also
			look for changes in the repository. That way
			you can check before an update if there's a possible conflict.
			You can also update selected files from the repository without
			updating the whole folder.

		<para>
			The columns are customizable. If you
			<action>right click</action> on any column header you will see a
			context menu allowing you to select which columns are displayed.
			You can also change column width by using the drag handle which
			appears when you move the mouse over a column boundary. These
			customizations are preserved, so you will see the same headings
			next time.
			Note that due to an implementation detail, you may see two different
			drag icons, depending on exactly where you position the mouse over the
			boundary. One has a solid vertical dividing line and the other has two
			thin vertical lines. Only the solid drag pointer works.

				If you want a flat view of your working copy, i.e. showing all files

				<guilabel>Show unmodified files</guilabel> checkbox to show

		<para>
			Often you want to look inside your files, to have a look at what
			you've changed. You can accomplish this by selecting a file which
			has changed, and selecting <guimenuitem>Diff</guimenuitem> from
			TortoiseSVN's context menu. This starts the external
			diff-viewer, which will then compare the current file with the
			pristine copy (<literal>BASE</literal> revision), which was stored
			after the last checkout or update.
		</para>
		<tip>
			<para>
				Even when not inside a working copy or when you have multiple
				versions of the file lying around, you can still display diffs:
			</para>
			<para>
				Select the two files you want to compare in explorer
				(e.g. using <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and the mouse) and
				choose <guimenuitem>Diff</guimenuitem> from TortoiseSVN's
				context menu. The file clicked last (the one with the focus,
				i.e. the dotted rectangle) will be regarded as the later
				one.
