  <para>
    Where branches are used to maintain separate lines of development,
    at some stage you will want to merge the changes made on one branch
    back into the trunk, or vice versa.
  </para>
  <para>
    It is important to understand how branching and merging works in
    Subversion before you start using it, as it can become quite complex.
    It is highly recommended that you read the chapter
    <ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.branchmerge.html">
      <citetitle>Branching and Merging</citetitle>
    </ulink>
    in the Subversion book, which gives a full description and many
    examples of how it is used.
  </para>
  <para>
    The next point to note is that merging <emphasis>always</emphasis>
    takes place within a working copy. If you want to merge changes
    <emphasis>into</emphasis> a branch, you have to have a working copy
    for that branch checked out, and invoke the merge wizard from that
    working copy using
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>Merge...</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>.
  </para>
  <para>
    In general it is a good idea to perform a merge into an unmodified
    working copy. If you have made other changes in your WC, commit those
    first. If the merge does not go as you expect, you may want to revert
    the changes, and the <guilabel>Revert</guilabel> command will discard
    <emphasis>all</emphasis> changes including any you made before the merge.
  </para>
  <para>
    There are three common use cases for merging which are handled in
    slightly different ways, as described below.
    The first page of the merge wizard asks you to select the method
    you need.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Merge a range of revisions</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          This method covers the case when you have made one or more
          revisions to a branch (or to the trunk) and you want to port
          those changes across to a different branch.
        </para>
        <para>
          What you are asking Subversion to do is this:
          <quote>
            Calculate the changes necessary to get [FROM] revision 1
            of branch A [TO] revision 7 of branch A, and apply those changes
            to my working copy (of trunk or branch B).
          </quote>
        </para>
        <para>
          If you leave the revision range empty, Subversion uses the
          merge-tracking features to calculate the correct revision range
          to use. This is known as a reintegrate or automatic merge.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Merge two different trees</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          This is a more general case of the reintegrate method.
          What you are asking Subversion to do is:
          <quote>
            Calculate the changes necessary to get [FROM] the head
            revision of the trunk [TO] the head revision of the branch, and
            apply those changes to my working copy (of the trunk).
          </quote>
          The net result is that trunk now looks exactly like the branch.
        </para>
        <para>
          If your server/repository does not support merge-tracking
          then this is the only way to merge a branch back to trunk.
          Another use case occurs when you are using vendor branches
          and you need to merge the changes following a new vendor drop
          into your trunk code. For more information read the chapter on
          <ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.vendorbr.html">

      In the <guilabel>From:</guilabel> field enter the full

      you want to port into your working copy.
      You may also click
      <guibutton>...</guibutton>
      to browse the repository and find the desired branch.
      If you have merged from this branch before, then just
      use the drop down list which shows a history of
      previously used URLs.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are merging from a renamed or deleted branch then you will
      have to go back to a revision where that branch still existed. In this
      case you will also need to specify that revision as a peg revision
      in the range of revisions being merged (see below), otherwise
      the merge will fail when it can't find that path at HEAD.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the <guilabel>Revision range to merge</guilabel> field
      enter the list of revisions you want to merge. This can
      be a single revision, a list of specific revisions
      separated by commas, or a range of revisions separated by a
      dash, or any combination of these.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you need to specify a peg revision for the merge, add the
      peg revision at the end of the revisions, e.g. <literal>5-7,10@3</literal>.
      In the above example, the revisions 5,6,7 and 10 would be merged,
      with 3 being the peg revision.
    </para>

      <para>
        There is an important difference in the way a revision
        range is specified with TortoiseSVN compared to the
        command line client. The easiest way to visualise it is
        to think of a fence with posts and fence panels.
      </para>
      <para>
        With the command line client you specify the changes
        to merge using two <quote>fence post</quote> revisions
        which specify the <emphasis>before</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>after</emphasis> points.
      </para>
      <para>
        With TortoiseSVN you specify the changeset to merge
        using <quote>fence panels</quote>. The reason for this
        becomes clear when you use the log dialog to specify
        revisions to merge, where each revision appears as
        a changeset.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you are merging revisions in chunks, the method
        shown in the Subversion book will have you merge
        100-200 this time and 200-300 next time. With
        TortoiseSVN you would merge 100-200 this time and
        201-300 next time.
      </para>
      <para>
        This difference has generated a lot of heat on the
        mailing lists. We acknowledge that there is a difference
        from the command line client, but we believe that for the
        majority of GUI users it is easier to understand the
        method we have implemented.
      </para>
    </important>
    <para>
      The easiest way to select the range of revisions you need
      is to click on <guibutton>Show Log</guibutton>, as this
      will list recent changes with their log comments.
      If you want to merge the changes from a single revision, just
      select that revision. If you want to merge changes from several
      revisions, then select that range
      (using the usual <keycap>Shift</keycap>-modifier).
      Click on <guibutton>OK</guibutton> and the list of revision
      numbers to merge will be filled in for you.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you want to merge changes back <emphasis>out</emphasis>
      of your working copy, to revert a change which has already
      been committed, select the revisions to revert and make sure
      the <guilabel>Reverse merge</guilabel> box is checked.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you have already merged some changes from this branch,
      hopefully you will have made a note of the last revision
      merged in the log message when you committed the change.
      In that case, you can use <guibutton>Show Log</guibutton>
      for the Working Copy to trace that log message.
      Remembering that we are thinking of revisions as
      changesets, you should Use the revision after the
      end point of the last merge as the start point for this
      merge. For example, if you have merged revisions 37 to 39
      last time, then the start point for this merge should be
      revision 40.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are using the merge tracking features of Subversion,
      you do not need to remember which revisions have already been
      merged - Subversion will record that for you. If you leave
      the revision range blank, all revisions which have not yet
      been merged will be included. Read
      <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-merge-tracking"/> to find out more.
    </para>
    <para>
      When merge tracking is used, the log dialog will show previously
      merged revisions, and revisions pre-dating the common ancestor
      point, i.e. before the branch was copied, as greyed out.
      The <guilabel>Hide non-mergeable revisions</guilabel>
      checkbox allows you to filter out these revisions completely
      so you see only the revisions which <emphasis>can</emphasis>
      be merged.
    </para>
    <para>
      If other people may be committing changes then be careful
      about using the HEAD revision. It may not refer to the
      revision you think it does if someone else made a commit
      after your last update.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you leave the range of revisions empty or have the
      radio button <guilabel>all revisions</guilabel> checked, then
      Subversion merges all not-yet merged revisions. This is known
      as a reintegrate or automatic merge.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are some conditions which apply to a reintegrate merge.
      Firstly, the server must support merge tracking.
      The working copy must be of depth infinite (no sparse checkouts),
      and it must not have any local modifications, switched items or
      items that have been updated to revisions other than HEAD.
      All changes to trunk made during branch development must have
      been merged across to the branch (or marked as having been merged).
      The range of revisions to merge will be calculated automatically.

      You can specify the depth to use for the merge, i.e. how far down

      default depth is <guilabel>Working copy</guilabel>, which uses
      the existing depth setting, and is almost always what you want.
    </para>
    <para>
      Most of the time you want merge to take account of the file's history,
      so that changes relative to a common ancestor are merged. Sometimes
      you may need to merge files which are perhaps related, but not in
      your repository. For example you may have imported versions 1 and 2 of
      a third party library into two separate directories. Although they
      are logically related, Subversion has no knowledge of this because
      it only sees the tarballs you imported. If you attempt to merge the
      difference between these two trees you would see a complete removal
      followed by a complete add. To make Subversion use only path-based
      differences rather than history-based differences, check the
      <guilabel>Ignore ancestry</guilabel> box. Read more about this
      topic in the Subversion book,

      You can specify the way that line ending and whitespace changes are handled.
      These options are described in <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-diff-eol-whitespace"/>.

      as real changes to be merged.

      The checkbox marked <guilabel>Force the merge</guilabel> is used to
      avoid a tree conflict where an incoming delete affects a file that

      deleted then there is no way to recover it, which is why that option
      is not checked by default.

      If you are using merge tracking and you want to mark a revision as
      having been merged, without actually doing the merge here, check the
      <guilabel>Only record the merge</guilabel> checkbox. There are two
      possible reasons you might want to do this. It may be that the merge
      is too complicated for the merge algorithms, so you code the changes
      by hand, then mark the change as merged so that the merge tracking
      algorithm is aware of it. Or you might want to prevent a particular
      revision from being merged. Marking it as already merged will prevent
      the merge occurring with merge-tracking-aware clients.

    <para>
      Now everything is set up, all you have to do is click on the

      <guibutton>Test Merge</guibutton> simulates the merge operation, but does
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> modify the working copy at all.
      It shows you a list of the files that will be changed by a real merge,
      and notes files where conflicts <emphasis>may</emphasis> occur.
      Because merge tracking makes the merge process a lot more complicated,
      there is no guaranteed way to find out in advance whether the merge
      will complete without conflicts, so files marked as conflicted in a
      test merge may in fact merge without any problem.
    </para>
    <para>
      The merge progress dialog shows each stage of the merge, with the
      revision ranges involved. This may indicate one more revision than
      you were expecting. For example if you asked to merge revision 123
      the progress dialog will report <quote>
        Merging revisions 122 through
        123
      </quote>. To understand this you need to remember that Merge is
      closely related to Diff. The merge process works by generating a list
      of differences between two points in the repository, and applying
      those differences to your working copy. The progress dialog is simply
      showing the start and end points for the diff.

      The merge is now complete. It's a good idea to have a look at the

        Whenever revisions are merged into a working copy,
        TortoiseSVN generates a log message from all the

        commit dialog.

      For Subversion clients and servers prior to 1.5, no merge information
      is stored and merged revisions have to be tracked manually.
      When you have tested the changes and come to commit this revision,
      your commit log message should <emphasis>always</emphasis>
      include the revision numbers which have been ported in the merge.
      If you want to apply another merge at a later time you will need to
      know what you have already merged, as you do not want to port a
      change more than once. For more information about this, refer to
      <!-- NOTE this reference to the 1.4 book is deliberate. This is the

      If your server and all clients are running Subversion 1.5 or higher,
      the merge tracking facility will record the revisions merged and avoid
      a revision being merged more than once. This makes your life much simpler
      as you can simply merge the entire revision range each time and know
      that only new revisions will actually be merged.

      Branch management is important. If you want to keep this branch up to
      date with the trunk, you should be sure to merge often so that the
      branch and trunk do not drift too far apart. Of course, you
      should still avoid repeated merging of changes, as explained above.

      Merge tracking information is stored in the <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal>

      the server stores that information in a database, and when you request merge,
      log or blame information, the server can respond appropriately. For the system
      to work properly you must ensure that the server, the repository and all clients

      Merging does not always go smoothly. Sometimes there is a
      conflict, and if you are merging multiple ranges, you generally
      want to resolve the conflict before merging of the next range
      starts. TortoiseSVN helps you through this process by showing
      the <emphasis>merge conflict callback</emphasis> dialog.

      It is likely that some of the changes will have merged smoothly,
      while other local changes conflict with changes already committed
      to the repository. All changes which can be merged are merged.
      The Merge Conflict Callback dialog gives you three different
      ways of handling the lines which are in conflict.

            If you are merging text files then these first two buttons
            allow you to merge non-conflicting lines as normal and always
            prefer one version where there are conflicts.
            Choosing <emphasis>Prefer local</emphasis> will select
            your local version in every conflict, i.e. it will prefer
            what was already there before the merge over the incoming
            change from the merge source. Likewise,
            <emphasis>Prefer repository</emphasis> will select the
            repository changes in every conflict, i.e. it will prefer
            the incoming changes from the merge source over what was
            already in your working copy. This sounds easy,
            but the conflicts often cover more lines than you think
            they will and you may get unexpected results.
          </para>
          <para>
            If your merge includes binary files, merging of conflicts in
            those is not possible in a line-by-line mode. A conflict
            in a binary file always refers to the complete file.
            Use <emphasis>Prefer local</emphasis> to select the local
            version as it was in your working copy prior to the merge, or
            <emphasis>Prefer repository</emphasis> to select the incoming
            file from the merge source in the repository.

            Normally you will want to look at the conflicts and resolve them
            yourself. In that case, choose the <guibutton>Edit Conflict</guibutton>
            which will start up your merge tool. When you are satisfied with
            the result, click <guibutton>Resolved</guibutton>.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The last option is to postpone resolution and continue
            with merging. You can choose to do that for the current
            conflicted file, or for all files in the rest of the merge.
            However, if there are further changes in that file, it
            will not be possible to complete the merge.

      If you do not want to use this interactive callback, there is a
      checkbox in the merge progress dialog <guilabel>Merge non-interactive</guilabel>.
      If this is set for a merge and the merge would result in a conflict,
      the file is marked as in conflict and the merge goes on. You will have
      to resolve the conflicts after the whole merge is finished.
      If it is not set, then before a file is marked as conflicted you get the
      chance to resolve the conflict <emphasis>during</emphasis> the merge.
      This has the advantage that if a file gets multiple merges (multiple
      revisions apply a change to that file), subsequent merges might succeed
      depending on which lines are affected. But of course you can't walk away
      to get a coffee while the merge is running ;)

      If you want to merge all changes from a feature branch
      back to trunk, then you can use the
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Merge reintegrate...</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>

      key while you right click on the file).

        <title>The Merge reintegrate Dialog</title>

      This dialog is very easy. All you have to do is set the options for
      the merge, as described in <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-merge-options"/>.
      The rest is done by TortoiseSVN automatically using merge tracking.

      When you develop a new feature on a separate branch it is a good
      idea to work out a policy for re-integration when the feature is
      complete. If other work is going on in <literal>trunk</literal>
      at the same time you may find that the differences become significant
      over time, and merging back becomes a nightmare.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the feature is relatively simple and development will not take
      long then you can adopt a simple approach, which is to keep
      the branch entirely separate until the feature is complete,
      then merge the branch changes back into trunk. In the merge wizard
      this would be a simple <guilabel>Merge a range of revisions</guilabel>,
      with the revision range being the revision span of the branch.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the feature is going to take longer and you need to account
      for changes in <literal>trunk</literal>, then you need to keep
      the branch synchronised. This simply means that periodically
      you merge trunk changes into the branch, so that the branch
      contains all the trunk changes <emphasis>plus</emphasis> the
      new feature. The synchronisation process uses
      <guilabel>Merge a range of revisions</guilabel>. When the feature
      is complete then you can merge it back to <literal>trunk</literal>
      using either <guilabel>Reintegrate a branch</guilabel> or
      <guilabel>Merge two different trees</guilabel>.
