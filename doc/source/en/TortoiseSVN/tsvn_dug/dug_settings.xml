						Exclude patterns are used to prevent unversioned files from
						showing up e.g. in the commit dialog. Files matching the
						patterns are also ignored by an import.
						Exclude files or directories by typing in the names or extensions.
						Patterns are separated by spaces e.g.
						<literal>*/bin */obj *.bak *.~?? *.jar *.[Tt]mp</literal>.
						The first two entries refer to directories, the 
						other four to files.
						These patterns use filename globbing. Read
						<xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-ignore-glob"/> for more information.

						Note that the exclude patterns you specify here will also
						affect other Subversion clients running on your PC, including

						</para>
					</caution>
					<para>
						This exclude pattern will affect all your projects.
						It is not versioned, so it will not affect other users.
						By contrast you can also use the versioned

						This option tells TortoiseSVN to set the filedates to
						the last commit time when doing a checkout or an update.
						Otherwise TortoiseSVN will use the current date.
						If you are developing software it is generally best
						to use the current date because build systems normally
						look at the datestamps to decide which files need
						compiling. If you use "last commit time" and revert
						to an older file revision, your project may not compile

			This page allows you to specify which of the TortoiseSVN context menu
			entries will show up in the main context menu, and which will appear
			in the TortoiseSVN submenu. By default most items are checked and
			appear in the submenu.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you have a very large number of files in your working copy
			folders, it can take a long time before the context menu appears
			when you <action>right click</action> on a folder. This is because
			Subversion fetches the status for all files when you ask for
			folder status. To avoid this delay you can uncheck the
			<guilabel>Fetch status for context menu</guilabel>
			box. Be warned that the context menu for folders will not always
			be correct, and may include items which should not really be there.
			For example, you will see
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Show Log</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			for an <literal>Added</literal> folder, which will not work because

				<figure id="tsvn-DUG-settings-dia-overlay">
					<title>The Settings Dialog, Look and Feel Page</title>
					<graphic fileref="../images/SettingsOverlay.png"/>
				</figure>
				This page allows you to choose the items for which TortoiseSVN will
				display icon overlays. Network drives can be very slow, so by default
				icons are not shown for working copies located on network shares.
				You can even disable all icon overlays, but where's the fun in that?
			</para>
			<para>
				By default, overlay icons will appear in all open/save dialogs
				as well as in Windows Explorer. If you want them to appear
				<emphasis>only</emphasis> in Windows Explorer, check the
				<guilabel>Show overlays only in explorer</guilabel> box.
			</para>
			<para>
				Normally the icon overlays act recursively, which means that the
				overlay for a folder shows the most significant status of all its
				subfolders. If there is a modified file deep in the hierarchy,
				the top level folder will also show modified status to remind you
				that there are buried changes.
				If you have <emphasis>very</emphasis> large working copies then
				you may find that the recursive status feature causes too much
				disk activity and disruption on your system, although this is not
				usually a problem. In that case you can uncheck
				<guilabel>Show overlay status icons recursively</guilabel> so
				that folder status is shown only for the folder itself.
			</para>
			<para>
				The <guilabel>Exclude Paths</guilabel> are used to tell TortoiseSVN for which
				paths <emphasis>not</emphasis> to show icon overlays and status columns.
				This is useful if you have some very big working copies containing
				only libraries which you won't change at all and therefore don't
				need the overlays. For example:
			</para>
			<para>
				<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename> will disable
				the overlays on <emphasis>only</emphasis> that specific folder. You
				still can see the overlays on all files and folder inside that folder.
			</para>
			<para>
				<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion*</filename> will disable the
				overlays on <emphasis>all</emphasis> files and folders whose path
				starts with <filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename>. That
				means you won't see overlays for any files and folders below that
				path.
			</para>
			<para>
				The same applies to the <guilabel>Include Paths</guilabel>. Except that
				for those paths the overlays are shown even if the overlays are disabled
				for that specific drive type.

							ignore some types of message and have the dialog
							close automatically if there are no critical changes.

						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no merges, adds or deletes</guilabel>
							means that the progress dialog will close if there were

						</para>
						<para>

						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no errors</guilabel>

				An external diff program may be used for comparing different

				The window titles are not pure filenames.

				<filename>filename : revision 123</filename>
				and
				<filename>filename : working copy</filename>

			<para>
				If you use the <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property to
				expand keywords, and in particular the <literal>revision</literal>
				of a file, then there may be a difference between files which
				is purely due to the current value of the keyword. Also if you use
				<literal>svn:eol-style = native</literal> the BAsE file will have
				pure <literal>LF</literal> line endings whereas your file will
				have <literal>CR-LF</literal> line endings. TSVN will normally hide
				these differences automatically by first parsing the BASE file to
				expand keywords and line endings before doing the diff operation.
				However, this can take a long time with large files. If
				<guilabel>Convert files when diffing against BASE</guilabel>

				A viewer program for unified-diff files (patch files).

			</para>
			<para>
				The original Windows NotePad program does not behave
				well on files which do not have standard CR-LF
				line-endings. Since most unified diff files have pure
				LF line-endings, they do not view well in NotePad.
				However, you can download a free NotePad replacement
				<ulink url="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">
					<citetitle>Notepad2</citetitle>
				</ulink>
				which not only displays the line-endings correctly,
				but also colour codes the added and removed lines.
