	<title>Viewing Differences</title>

	</indexterm>
	<para>
		One of the commonest requirements in project development is to
		see what has changed. You might want to look at the differences
		between two revisions of the same file, or the differences between
		two separate files.
		TortoiseSVN provides a builtin tool named 
		<application>TortoiseMerge</application> for viewing differences of
		text files. For viewing differences of image files, TortoiseSVN
		also has a tool named <application>TortoiseIDiff</application>.
		Of course, you can user your own favourite diff program if you
		like.

						working on trunk), you can use the explorer context menu.
						Just hold down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key while you

						<menuchoice>
							<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
							<guimenuitem>Diff with URL</guimenuitem>

						If you want to see the difference between two revisions

						If you want to see the changes made to all files
						in a particular revision in one view, you can
						use Unified-Diff output (GNU patch format). This shows
						only the differences with a few lines of context. It
						is harder to read than a visual file compare, but will
						show all the changes together. From the Revision Log
						dialog select the revision of interest, then select
						<guimenuitem>Show Differences as Unified-Diff</guimenuitem>

		The builtin tools supplied with TortoiseSVN do not support viewing
