		For every change you make and commit, you should provide
		a log message for that change. That way you can later find out
		what changes you made and why, and you have a detailed log for
		your development process.

	<para>
		The Revision Log Dialog retrieves all those log messages and shows them
		to you.
		The display is divided into 3 panes.
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The top pane shows a list of revisions where changes to the
					file/folder have been committed. This summary includes the
					date and time, the person who committed the revision and the
					start of the log message.
				</para>
				<para>
					Lines shown in blue indicate that something has been copied
					to this development line (perhaps from a branch).
				</para>

					The middle pane shows the full log message for the selected
					revision.

					The bottom pane shows a list of all files and folders that
					were changed as part of the selected revision.

		commands which you can use to get even more information about the

						Update your working copy to the selected

						This is very useful for undoing an earlier change when

						Revert to an earlier revision. If you have made several

			</para>
			<para>
				Subversion uses revision numbers to mean 2 different things.
				A revision generally represents the state of the repository at

				which created that revision, eg. "Done in r1234" means that the
				changes committed in r1234 implement feature X.
				To make it clearer which sense is being used, we use two
