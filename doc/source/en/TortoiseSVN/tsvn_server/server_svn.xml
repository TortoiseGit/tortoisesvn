			There may be situations where it's not possible to use Apache as

			- a lightweight stand-alone server which uses a custom protocol

		</para>
		<para>
			In most cases svnserve is easier to setup

		<title>Running svnserve</title>
		<para>
			Now that svnserve is installed, you need it running
			on your server.  The simplest approach is to run the following from a DOS
			shell or create a windows shortcut:
<screen>
svnserve.exe --daemon
</screen>
			svnserve will now start waiting for incoming requests
			on port 3690. The --daemon switch tells svnserve to run
			as a daemon process, so it will always exist until it is manually terminated.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you have not yet created a repository, follow the
			instructions given with the Apache server setup
			<xref linkend="tsvn-serversetup-apache-4"/>.
		</para>
		<para>
			To test that svnserve is working, use
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Repo-Browser</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			to view a repository.
		</para>
		<para>
			Assuming your repository is located in
			<filename>c:\repos\TestRepo</filename>, and your server is called
			<filename>localhost</filename>, enter:
<screen>
svn://localhost/repos/TestRepo
</screen>
			when prompted by the repo browser.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can also increase security and save time entering Url's with
			svnserve by using the --root switch to set the root
			location and restrict access to a specified directory on the server:
<screen>
svnserve.exe --daemon --root drive:\path\to\repository
</screen>
			Using the previous test as a guide, svnserve would now run as:
<screen>
svnserve.exe --daemon --root c:\repos
</screen>
			And in TortoiseSVN our repo-browser Url is now shortened to:
<screen>
svn://localhost/TestRepo
</screen>
			Note that the --root switch is also needed if your repository is located 
			on a different partition or drive than the location of svnserve
			on your server.
		</para>
		<warning>

				Do not create or access a Berkeley DB repository on a network share.
				It <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> exist on a remote filesystem.
				Not even if you have the network drive mapped to a drive letter.
				If you attempt to use Berkeley DB on a network share,
				the results are unpredictable - you may see mysterious errors
				right away, or it may be months before you discover that your

			<para>
				If you are concerned about always having a user logged in on your 
				server, or worried about someone shutting down svnserve or
				forgetting to restart it after a reboot, it is possible to run
				svnserve as a windows service. Starting with Subversion 1.4,
				svnserve can be installed as a native windows service, 
				in previous versions it can be installed using a wrapper.
			</para>
			<para>
				To install svnserve as a native windows service, execute the following
				command all on one line to create a service which is automatically
				started when windows starts.
<screen>
sc create svnserve binpath= "c:\svnserve\svnserve.exe --service 
	--root c:\repos" displayname= "Subversion" depend= tcpip start= auto
</screen>

					Microsoft now recommend services to be run as under either the
					Local Service or Network Service account. Refer to
					<ulink 
						url="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/topics/serversecurity/serviceaccount/default.mspx">
						<citetitle>The Services and Service Accounts Security Planning Guide</citetitle>
					</ulink>.
					To create the service under the Local Service account, append the
					following to the example above.
<screen>
obj= "NT AUTHORITY\LocalService"
</screen>
					Note that you would have to give the Local Service account
					appropriate rights to both Subversion and your repositories,
					as well as any applications which are used by hook scripts.
				</para>
			</tip>
			<para>
				To install svnserve using a wrapper, one written specifically for
				svnserve is <literal>SvnService</literal>. Magnus Norddahl adapted
				some skeleton code from Microsoft, and further improvements have
				been made by Daniel Thompson.
				Daniel's version is available for download from

			</para>
			<para>
				More generic tools like
				<ulink url="http://www.firedaemon.com/">
					<citetitle>firedaemon</citetitle>
				</ulink>
				will also work. Note that you will still need to run
				svnserve with the --daemon switch.

				Finally, if you have access to the Windows 2000/XP/2003
				resource kit you can use
				<ulink url="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q137890/">
					<citetitle>SrvAny</citetitle>
				</ulink>
				from Microsoft.
				This is the official Microsoft way of running programs as services,
				but it is a bit messy (requires registry editing) and if you stop
				the service it will kill svnserve immediately without letting it
				clean up.
				If you don't want to install the entire reskit, you can

		<title>Authentication with svnserve</title>
		<para>
			The default svnserve setup provides anonymous read-only access.
			This means that you can use an <filename>svn://</filename> Url
			to checkout and update, or use the repo-browser in TortoiseSVN
			to view the repository, but you won't be able to commit any changes.
		</para>
		<para>
			To enable write access to a repository, you need to edit the
			<filename>conf/svnserve.conf</filename> file in your repository
			directory.  This file controls the configuration of the
			svnserve daemon, and also contains useful documentation.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can enable anonymous write access by simply setting:
<screen>
[general]
anon-access = write
</screen>
			However, you will not know who has made changes to a repository,
			as the <literal>svn:author</literal> property will be empty.
			You will also be unable to control who makes changes to a
			repository.  This is a somewhat risky setup!
		</para>
		<para>
			One way to overcome this is to create a password database:
<screen>
[general]
anon-access = none
auth-access = write
password-db = userfile
</screen>
			Where <literal>userfile</literal> is a file which exists in
			the same directory as <filename>svnserve.conf</filename>.  This
			file can live elsewhere in your filesytem (useful for when you
			have multiple repositories which require the same access rights)
			and may be referenced using an absolute path, or a path
			relative to the <filename>conf</filename> directory.
			If you include a path, it must be written
			<filename>/the/unix/way</filename>.
			Using \ or drive letters will not work.
			The <filename>userfile</filename> should have a structure of:
<screen>
[users]
username = password
...
</screen>
			This example would deny all access for unauthenticated
			(anonymous) users, and give read-write access to users listed
			in <filename>userfile</filename>.
		</para>
		<tip>
			<para>
				If you maintain multiple repositories using the same password
				database, the use of an authentication realm will make life
				easier for users, as TortoiseSVN can cache your credentials
				so that you only have to enter them once.  More information
				can be found in the Subversion book, specifically in the 
				sections
				<ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch06s03.html#svn-ch-6-sect-3.2.1">

		<title>Authentication with svn+ssh</title>
		<para>
			Another way to authenticate users with a svnserve
			based server is to use a secure shell (SSH) to tunnel
			requests through.
		</para>
		<para>
			With this approach, svnserve is not run as a daemon
			process, rather, the secure shell starts svnserve
			for you, running it as the SSH authenticated user. To
			enable this, you need a secure shell daemon on your server.
		</para>
		<para>
			It is beyond the scope of this documentation to detail the
			installation and setup of a secure shell, however you can
			find further information in the
			<ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net/?q=faq">
				<citetitle>TortoiseSVN FAQ</citetitle>

		<title>Path-based Authorization with svnserve</title>
		<para>
			Starting with Subversion 1.3, svnserve supports the same
			<literal>mod_authz_svn</literal> path-based authorization scheme
			that is available with the Apache server. You need to edit the
			<filename>conf/svnserve.conf</filename> file in your repository
			directory and add a line referring to your authorization file.
<screen>
[general]
authz-db = authz
</screen>
			Here, <filename>authz</filename> is a file you create to define
			the access permissions. You can use a separate file for each
			repository, or you can use the same file for several repositories.
			Read <xref linkend="tsvn-serversetup-mod_authz_svn"/>
			for a description of the file format.
