      Because TortoiseSVN is being developed all the time
      it is sometimes hard to keep the documentation completely
      up to date. We maintain an
      <ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.net/faq.html">
        <citetitle>online FAQ</citetitle>
      </ulink>
      which contains a selection of the questions we are asked
      the most on the TortoiseSVN mailing lists
      <email>dev@tortoisesvn.tigris.org</email> and
      <email>users@tortoisesvn.tigris.org</email>.
    </para>
    <para>
      We also maintain a project
      <ulink url="https://sourceforge.net/p/tortoisesvn/tickets/">
        <citetitle>Issue Tracker</citetitle>
      </ulink>
      which tells you about some of the things we have on our To-Do list,
      and bugs which have already been fixed. If you think you have found
      a bug, or want to request a new feature, check here first to see
      if someone else got there before you.

      If you have a question which is not answered anywhere
      else, the best place to ask it is on one of the mailing lists:
