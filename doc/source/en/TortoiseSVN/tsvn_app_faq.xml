		<para>
			Because TortoiseSVN is being developed all the time
			it is sometimes hard to keep the documentation completely
			up to date. We maintain an interactive online FAQ at 
			<ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net?q=node/1">
				<citetitle>Sourceforge.net</citetitle>
			</ulink>
			which contains a selection of the questions we are asked
			the most on the TortoiseSVN mailing list
			<email>dev@tortoisesvn.tigris.org</email>.
		</para>
		<para>
			We also maintain a project Issue Tracker at 
			<ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.berlios.de/issues/index.php?order=id&amp;sort=desc&amp;status=all">
				<citetitle>Berlios.de</citetitle>
			</ulink>
			which tells you about some of the things we have on our To-Do list,
			and bugs which have already been fixed. If you think you have found
			a bug, or want to request a new feature, check here first to see
			if someone else got there before you.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you have a question which is not answered anywhere
			else, the best place to ask it is on the mailing list.
