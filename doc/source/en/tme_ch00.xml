			When working on a project, may it be an open-source project where
			several people review your code or a commercial
			project where you sell a component with your sourcecode there will
			be people and customers who find bugs or want to improve your 
			project. To do that they send you patches which you have to review
			and decide if you want to apply them.
		</para>
		<para>
			TortoiseMerge helps you with both those tasks:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Reviewing patches</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Applying the patches</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para>
			TortoiseMerge also helps you eliminating conflicted files which can
			occur if you're working with a source control system and others
			are working on the same files as you.
