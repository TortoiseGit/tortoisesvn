								<primary>global ignore</primary>
							</indexterm>
							Exclude patterns are used to prevent unversioned files from
							showing up e.g. in the commit dialog. Files matching the
							patterns are also ignored by an import.
							Exclude files or directories by typing in the names or extensions.
							Patterns are separated by spaces e.g.
							<literal>bin obj *.bak *.~?? *.jar *.[Tt]mp</literal>.
							The first two entries refer to directories, the 
							other four to files.
						</para>
						<warning>
							If you use the subversion configuration file to set
							a <literal>global-ignores</literal> pattern, it will
							override the settings you made here. The Subversion
							configuration file is accessed using the
							<guibutton>Edit</guibutton> as described below.
						</warning>
						<para>
							This exclude pattern will affect all your projects.
							It is not versioned, so it will not affect other users.
							By contrast you can also use the versioned
							<literal>svn:ignore</literal> 
							property to exclude files or directories from version
							control. You can set the <literal>svn:ignore</literal> 
							property using the 
							<menuchoice>
								<guimenuitem>Add to Ignore List</guimenuitem>
							</menuchoice>
							command. After commiting every other user will have
							the same <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property set
							for this project / directory as you.
							If you want to remove an ignored file from
							<literal>svn:ignore</literal>,
							you have to edit the parent folder properties. Read
							<xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-ignore"/> and
							<xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-propertypage"/>

					<term>Set filedates to "last commit time"</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							This option tells TortoiseSVN to set the filedates to
							the last commit time when doing a checkout or an update.
							Otherwise TortoiseSVN will use the current date.
							If you are developing software it is generally best
							to use the current date because build systems normally
							look at the datestamps to decide which files need
							compiling. If you use "last commit time" and revert
							to an older file revision, your project may not compile
							as you expect it to.

				<varlistentry>
					<term>Progress Dialog</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							TortoiseSVN can automatically close all progress dialogs 
							when the action is finished without error. This setting
							allows you to select the conditions for closing the
							dialogs. The default (recommended) setting is
							<guilabel>Close manually</guilabel>
							which allows you to review all messages and check what
							has happened. However, you may decide that you want to
							ignore some types of message and have the dialog
							close automatically if there are no critical changes.
						</para>
						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no merges, adds or deletes</guilabel>
							means that the progress dialog will close if there were
							simple updates, but if changes from the repository were
							merged with yours, or if any files were added or deleted,
							the dialog will remain open.
						</para>
						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no conflicts</guilabel>
							relaxes the criteria further and will close the dialog
							even if there were merges, adds or deletes. However,
							if there were any conflicts or errors, the dialog
							remains open.
						</para>
						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no errors</guilabel>
							always closes the dialog even if there were conflicts.
							The only condition that keeps the dialog open is an
							error condition, which occurs when subversion is unable
							to complete the task. For example, an update fails
							because the server is inaccessible, or a commit fails
							because the working copy is out-of-date.

			"Recurse into folders to fetch the status" box.
			You can even disable all icon overlays, but where's the fun in that?

		<para>
			The <guilabel>Exclude Paths</guilabel> are used to tell TortoiseSVN for which

			This is useful if you have some very big working copies containing

			need the overlays. For example:
		</para>
		<para>
			<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename> will disable
			the overlays on <emphasis>only</emphasis> that specific folder. You
			still can see the overlays on all files and folder inside that folder.
		</para>
		<para>
			<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion*</filename> will disable the
			overlays on <emphasis>all</emphasis> files and folders whose path
			starts with <filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename>. That
			means you won't see overlays for any files and folders below that
			path.
		</para>
		<para>
			The same applies to the <guilabel>Include Paths</guilabel>. Only that for those
			paths the overlays are shown even if the overlays are disabled for
			that specific drive type.

		</para>
		<sect3 id="tsvn-DUG-settings-Diff">
			<title>Diff Program</title>
			<para>
				An external diff program may be used for comparing different
				revisions of files. The external program will need to
				obtain the filenames from the command line, along with
				any other command line options. TortoiseSVN uses
				substitution parameters prefixed with <literal>%</literal>.
				When it encounters one of these it will substitute the
				appropriate value. The order of the parameters will depend
				on the Diff program you use.
				<variablelist>

						<term>%base</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								The original file without your changes

								The window title for your file
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
				</variablelist>
			</para>
			<para>
				The window titles are not pure filenames.
				TortoiseSVN treats that as a name to display and creates
				the names accordingly. So e.g. if you're doing a
				diff from a file in revision 123 with a file 
				in your working copy, the names will be
				<filename>filename : revision 123</filename>
				and
				<filename>filename : working copy</filename>
			</para>
			<para>
				For example, with ExamDiff Pro:
<screen>
C:\Path-To\ExamDiff.exe %base %mine
</screen>
				or with KDiff3:
<screen>
C:\Path-To\kdiff3.exe %base %mine --L1 %bname --L2 %yname
</screen>
			</para>
			<para>
				If you use the <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property to
				expand keywords, and in particular the <literal>revision</literal>
				of a file, then there may be a difference between files which
				is purely due to the current value of the keyword. TSVN can
				hide this artificial difference by first parsing the files
				for keywords before doing the diff operation. However, this
				can take some time, especially with large files, so this
				behaviour is optional. If
				<guilabel>Convert files when diffing against BASE</guilabel>
				is checked then TSVN will pre-process the files.
