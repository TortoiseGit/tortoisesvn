		<sect2 id="tsvn-DUG-import-1">
			<title>Repository Layout</title>
			<para>
			Before you import your data into the repository you should
			first think about how you want to organize your data. If you
			use one of the recommended layouts you will later have it much
			easier.
			</para>
			<para>
			There are some standard, recommended ways to organize a
			repository. Most people create a <filename>trunk</filename>
			directory to hold the "main line" of development, a
			<filename>branches</filename> directory to contain branch
			copies, and a <filename>tags</filename> directory to contain
			tag copies. If a repository holds only one project, then
			often people create these top-level directories:
			</para>
			<screen>
/trunk
/branches
/tags
			</screen>
			<para>
			If a repository contains multiple projects, people often
			index their layout by branch:
			</para>
			<screen>
/trunk/paint
/trunk/calc
/branches/paint
/branches/calc
/tags/paint
/tags/calc
			</screen>
			<para>&hellip;or by project:</para>
			<screen>
/paint/trunk
/paint/branches
/paint/tags
/calc/trunk
/calc/branches
/calc/tags
			</screen>
			<para>
			Of course, you're free to ignore these common layouts.  You
			can create any sort of variation, whatever works best for you or
			your team.  Remember that whatever you choose, it's not a
			permanent commitment.  You can reorganize your repository at any
			time.  Because branches and tags are ordinary directories,
			TortoiseSVN can move or rename them however you wish.  Switching
			from one layout to another is just a matter of issuing a series
			of server-side moves; If you don't like the way things are
			organized in the repository, just juggle the directories around.
			</para>
			<para>
			So if you haven't already created a basic folder structure inside
			your repository you should do that now:
			<orderedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>create a new empty folder on your harddrive
				</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>create your desired folder structure inside
				that folder &mdash; don't put any files in it yet!
				</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>import this structure into the repository
				</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="tsvn-DUG-import-2">
			<title>Import</title>
			<indexterm><primary>tempfiles</primary></indexterm>
			<para>
			Before you import your project into a repository you should:
			<orderedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Remove all files which are not needed to
				build the project (temporary files, files which are
				generated by a compiler e.g. *.obj, compiled

			</para>
			<para>
			Now select the <emphasis>parent import</emphasis> folder of your
			directory structure in the windows explorer and <action>right click
			</action> to open the context menu. Select the command
			<menuchoice><guimenuitem>Import...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> which brings up a dialog

		<title>Getting Status Information</title>
		<indexterm><primary>status</primary></indexterm>
		<para>
		While you are working on your working copy you often need to know
		which files you have changed/added/removed or renamed, or even which
		files got changed and committed by others.
		</para>

					<title>Explorer showing icon overlays</title>
					<graphic fileref="images/Overlays.png"/>
				</figure>
			Now that you have checked out a working copy from a Subversion
			repository you can see your files in the windows explorer with
			changed icons. This is one of the reasons why TortoiseSVN is so
			popular. TortoiseSVN adds a so called overlay icon to each
			file icon which overlaps the original file icon. Depending on
			the Subversion status of the file the overlay icon is different.
			 <graphic fileref="images/InSubVersionIcon.png"/>A fresh checked out working
			 copy has a green checkmark as overlay.
			That means the Subversion status is 	<literal>normal</literal>.
			<graphic fileref="images/ModifiedIcon.png"/>As soon as you start editing a file,
			the status changes to <literal>modified</literal>
			and the icon overlay then changes to a red exclamation
			mark. That way you can easily see which files were changed
			since you last updated your working copy and need to be commited.
			<graphic fileref="images/ConflictIcon.png"/>If during an update a <literal>conflict</literal> occurs then
			the icon changes to a yellow exclamation mark.
			<graphic fileref="images/AddedIcon.png"/> The plus sign tells you that a file or folder has been scheduled to be
			<literal>added</literal> to version control.
			<graphic fileref="images/DeletedIcon.png"/> This Icon shows you that some files or folders inside the current folder
			have been scheduled do be <literal>deleted</literal> from version control
			or a file under version control is missing in a folder.
			</para>
			<para>
			The folder icons also have icon overlays displayed. By default,
			only the status of the folder itself is shown. But you can
			change that behaviour in the settings (context menu, Settings...)
			so that the status of folders is shown recursively. This will
			make the icon overlays for folders slower and is therefore
			not recommended on slower machines. I'm using that setting on
			my machine (PIII, 700MHz, 512MB RAM) without problems. With this
			setting each folder shows the status of all files below it,
			where status <literal>conflict</literal> overrides <literal>modified</literal>
			and <literal>modified</literal> overrides <literal>normal</literal>.
			So you can easily see if there's a file with a conflict or a modified file in a folder.
			<note>
				<title>Slow Overlays</title>
				<para>
				You may notice that if you enable the recursive overlay for folders
				that the explorer slows down remarkably when browsing working
				copies. This depends on how big your working copy is and how much
				RAM Windows can use for file index caching. Usually it's only
				very slow the first time you browse such a directory &mdash; if
				you browse the same directory later again it's much faster.
				</para>
			</note>
			</para>
			<para>
			Unlike <application>TortoiseCVS</application> (the CVS shell
			integration) no overlay icon for unversioned files is shown.
			We do this because the number of icon overlays are limited system wide
			and should be used economically.

		Occasionally you may want changes done by others to get

		getting changes from the server to your local copy is
		known as <literal>updating</literal>. Updating may be done on
		single files, a set of selected files, or recursively on
		entire directory hierarchies. To update, select the files
		and/or directories you want, <action>right click</action> and select
		<menuchoice><guimenuitem>Update</guimenuitem></menuchoice> in the explorer context menu.
		A window will pop up displaying the progress of the

		<para>
		TortoiseSVN also allows you to update your working copy to a specific

		<menuchoice><guimenuitem>Update to Revision...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and first opens
		a dialog where you can enter the required revision.
		</para>
		<para>
		The <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Update to Revision...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> command allows

		<title>Resolving Conflicts</title>
		<indexterm><primary>conflict</primary></indexterm>
		<para>
		Once in a while, you will get a <emphasis>conflict</emphasis> when
		you update your files from the repository. A conflict
		occurs when two or more developers have changed the same
		few lines of a file. As Subversion knows nothing of your
		project, it leaves resolving the conflicts to the developers.
		Whenever a conflict is reported, you should open the file in
		question, and search for lines starting with the string
		<literal>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
		</literal>. The conflicting area is marked like this:
<screen>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; filename
    your changes
=======
    code merged from repository
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; revision
</screen>
		Also, for every conflicted file Subversion places three
		additional files in your directory:
		<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>filename.ext.working</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>This is your file as it existed in your
				working copy before you updated your working copy
				&mdash; that is, without conflict markers. This file has
				your latest changes in it and nothing else.
				</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>filename.ext.merge-left.rOLDREV</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>This is the file that was the BASE
				revision before you updated your working copy. That is,
				it the file that you checked out before you made
				your latest edits.
				</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>filename.ext.merge-right.rNEWREV</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>This is the file that your Subversion
				client just received from the server when you updated
				your working copy. This file corresponds to the HEAD
				revision of the repository.
				</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

		Here * represents some random digits that Subversion chooses,
		OLDREV is the revision number of the file in your .svn directory,
		and NEWREV is the revision number of the repository HEAD.
		</para>
		<para>
		You can either launch an external merge tool / conflict
		editor with the <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Edit Conflict</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
		context menu or you can use any other editor to manually
		resolve the conflict. You should decide what the code
		should look like and do the necessary changes.
		</para>
		<para>
		Afterwards execute the command <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Resolved</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
		from the context menu and commit your modifications to the

		One of the features of version control systems is the ability

		This line is known as a <firstterm>branch</firstterm>.
		Branches are usually used to try out new features without
		disturbing the main branch of development with compiler
		errors and bugs. As soon as the new feature of the branch
		is stable enough then the branch is <firstterm>merged</firstterm>
		back into the main branch (the trunk).
		</para>
		<para>
		Another feature of version control systems is the ability
		to mark particular revisions (e.g. a release version),
		so you can at any time recreate a certain build or
		environment. This proces is known as <firstterm>tagging</firstterm>.
		</para>
		<para>
		Subversion does not know a special command for branching
		or tagging. Subversion uses so called <literal>cheap copies</literal>
		instead. Cheap copies are something similar to links,
		which means that no actual copy is made but just a link
		to a specific file/revision is created.
		</para>
		<para>
		If you have imported your project with the recommended
		directory structure creating a branch or tag version is very simple:

		<figure id="tsvn-DUG-branchtag-dia-1">
			<title>The Branch/Tag Dialog</title>
			<graphic fileref="images/Copy.png"/>
		</figure>

		Select the parent folder of your working copy and select
		the command <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Branch/Tag...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the
		context menu. Enter the URL to the repository path for
		branches or tags into the dialog. So instead of <filename>/trunk/
		</filename> you would now use <filename>/tags/tagname</filename> where
		<filename>tagname</filename> would be e.g. "ProjectName_v1.10".

<screen>
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/...

    C:/SVNRepository/branches/ProjectName_SpecialDebugBuildBasedOn_v1.09/
