					<para>
						The Apache based Subversion server uses the
						WebDAV protocol which is supported by many other

						a repository as a "Webfolder" in the Windows
						explorer and then access it like any other
						folder in the filesystem

					<para>
						You can point your browser to the URL of your
						repository and browse the contents of it without
						having a Subversion client installed. This
						gives access to your data to a much wider circle of
						users.

		<title>Installing Apache</title>
		<para>
			The first thing you need before installing Apache is a computer
			with either Windows2000 / WinXP+SP1 or Windows2003.
			<warning>
				<para>
					Please note that Windows XP without the servicepack 1
					will lead to bogus network data and could therefore
					corrupt your repository!
				</para>
			</warning>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Download the latest version of the Apache
						webserver from
						<ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi">
							<citetitle>http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi</citetitle>
						</ulink>.
						Make sure that you download the version &gt; 2.0.54 -
						the version 1.3.xx won't work! Also, versions lower than
						2.0.54 won't work with Subversion 1.2 because of a bug in
						how Apache &lt; 2.0.54 was built for Windows.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Once you have the Apache2 installer you
						can doubleclick on it and it will guide you through
						the installation process. Make sure that you enter
						the server-URL correctly (if you don't have a dns name
						for your server just enter the ip-address). I recommend
						to install apache
						<literal>for All Users, on Port 80, as a Service</literal>.
						Note: if you already have IIS or any other
						program running which listens on port 80 the
						installation might fail. If that happens, go to the
						programs directory,
						<filename>\Apache Group\Apache2\conf</filename>
						and locate the file
						<filename>httpd.conf</filename>. Edit that file so that
						<literal>Listen 80</literal> is changed to a free
						port, e.g. <literal>Listen 81</literal>.
						Then restart the installation - this time it should
						finish without problems.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Now test if the Apache-webserver is running
						correctly by pointing your webbrowser to
						<systemitem class="url">http://localhost/</systemitem>
						- a preconfigured Website should show up.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<caution>
				<para>
					If you decide to install Apache as a service, be warned that
					by default it will run as the local system account.
					It would be a more secure practice for you to create a
					separate account for Apache to run as.
				</para>
				<para>
					Make sure that the account on the server that Apache is running as
					has an explicit entry in the repository directory's access control 
					list (right-click directory | properties | security), with full 
					control.  Otherwise, users will not be able to commit their changes.
				</para>
				<para>
					Even if Apache runs as local system, you still need such an entry 
					(which will be the SYSTEM account in this case).
				</para>
				<para>
					If Apache does not have this permission set up, your users will get 
					"Access denied" error messages, which show up in the Apache error log 
					as error 500.

			Now you have set up Apache and Subversion, but Apache doesn't
			know how to handle Subversion clients like TortoiseSVN yet.
			To get Apache to know which URL shall be used for Subversion
			repositories you have to edit the Apache config file (usually
			located in
			<filename>c:\program files\apache group\apache2\conf\httpd.conf</filename>)
			with any text editor you like (e.g. Notepad):

SVNParentPath D:\SVN
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Subversion repositories"
AuthUserFile passwd
#AuthzSVNAccessFile svnaccessfile
Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>
						This configures Apache so that all your Subversion
						repositories are physically located below
						<filename>D:\SVN</filename>. The repositories are
						served to the outside world from the URL:

						and create the file by entering
<screen>
bin\htpasswd -c passwd &lt;username&gt;

						Using a <filename>passwd</filename> file limits and 
						grants access to all of your repositories as a unit. 
						If you want more control over which users have 
						access each folder inside a repository you can 
						uncomment the line
<screen>
#AuthzSVNAccessFile svnaccessfile
</screen>
						and create a Subversion access file. Apache will 
						make sure that only valid users are able to access 
						your <filename>/svn</filename> location, and will then 
						pass the username to Subversion's AuthzSVNAccessFile 
						module so that it can enforce more granular access 
						based upon rules listed in the Subversion access file.
						Note that paths are specified either as
						<literal>repos:path</literal> or simply
						<literal>path</literal>. If you don't specify a
						particular repository, that access rule will apply to
						all repositories under
						<literal>SVNParentPath</literal>.

			<title>Use SVNParentPath</title>
			<indexterm>
				<primary>SVNParentPath</primary>
			</indexterm>
			<para>
				If you used the SVNParentPath directive then you don't have to
				change the Apache config file everytime you add a new Subversion
				repository. Simply create the new repository under the same
				location as the first repository and you're done! In my company
				I have direct access to that specific folder on the server via
				SMB (normal windows file access). So I just create a new folder
				there, run the TortoiseSVN command
				<menuchoice>
					<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
					<guimenuitem>Create repository here...</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice>
				and a new project has a home...

			<indexterm>
				<primary>Index of projects</primary>
			</indexterm>
			<para>
				The advantage of using the SVNParentPath directive is that
				you don't have to change the Apache config each time you
				create a new repository, but you also don't have an index
				of all created and available projects. If you point your
				browser to the path SVNParentPath points to, you will get
				a nasty error page showing.
			</para>
			<para>
				To avoid that ugly error page and have a nice looking listing
				of all available projects instead, you can use the following PHP
				script which generates the index for you automatically.  (You

				below file).

					Save the file to <filename>bin/openssl.cnf</filename>.

					Next you need to create an SSL certificate.
					To do that open a command prompt (DOS-Box) and change to
					the apache folder (e.g.
					<filename>C:\program files\apache group\apache2</filename>)
					and type the following command:
<screen>
bin\openssl req -config bin\openssl.cnf -new -out my-server.csr
</screen>
					You will be asked for a passphrase. Please don't use simple
					words but whole sentences, e.g. a part of a poem. The
					longer the phrase the better. Also you have to enter the
					URL of you server. All other questions are optional but I
					recommend to fill out those too. Next type the commands
<screen>
bin\openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out my-server.key
</screen>
					and (on one line)
<screen>
bin\openssl x509 -in my-server.csr -out my-server.cert
                 -req -signkey my-server.key -days 4000
</screen>
					This will create a certificate which will expire in
					4000 days. And finally enter:
<screen>
bin\openssl x509 -in my-server.cert -out my-server.der.crt -outform DER
</screen>
					These commands created some files in the Apache folder 
					(<filename>my-server.der.crt</filename>,
					<filename>my-server.csr</filename>,
					<filename>my-server.key</filename>,
					<filename>.rnd</filename>,
					<filename>privkey.pem</filename>,
					<filename>my-server.cert</filename>).
					Copy the files to the folder
					<filename>conf/ssl</filename> (e.g.
					<filename>C:\program files\apache group\apache2\conf\ssl</filename>)
					- if this folder does not exist you have to create it first.

			<title>Forcing SSL access</title>
			<para>
				When you've set up SSL to make your repository more secure, you
				might want to disable the normal access via non-ssl (http) and
				only allow https access.
				To do this, you have to add another directive to the Subversion
				&lt;Location&gt; block: <literal>SSLRequireSSL</literal>.
			</para>
			<para>
					An example &lt;Location&gt; block would look like this:
<screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
DAV svn
SVNParentPath D:\SVN
SSLRequireSSL
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Subversion repositories"
AuthUserFile passwd
#AuthzSVNAccessFile svnaccessfile
Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
